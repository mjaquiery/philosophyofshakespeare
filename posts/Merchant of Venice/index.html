            <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The gold, silver and lead caskets, which I will argue provide the key to
the play, represent respectively &quot;gain[ing] what many men desire,&quot;
&quot;get[ting] as much as [one] deserves&quot; and &quot;giv[ing] and
hazard[ing] all [one] hath&quot; (2.9.20-24, 2.9.36). The gold casket
symbolises the unrestrained sensuality and self-love of &quot;the fool
multitude that choose by show,&quot; whereas the lead and silver caskets seem
to represent respectively the Christian injunction to care for others
without seeking any sort of return and the Jewish code, which values
just returns, whether in the form of dutiful gratitude or retribution
(2.9.26). Whereas the gold undoubtedly symbolises the baser natural
impulses, the silver and lead represent conventional codes which teach
their adherents to transcend or restrain these impulses (2.9.26). The
situation is more complex in the case of the silver casket, however,
since, although the wish to &quot;get what [one] deserves&quot; may be
reinforced by religious doctrine, it is also presented in the play as a
powerful natural urge. The key issue which the play is designed to
examine concerns the extent to which these three principles tend to
support, or, conversely, degrade the deep attachments which, in
Shakespeare's view, provide the ultimate good. Shakespeare aims to
explore this issue in an entirely open-minded way, whilst taking care to
conform outwardly to the opinions of his time.</p>
<h1>The Lead Casket: to &quot;Give and Hazard All&quot;</h1>
<p>At first Antonio denies that his nebulous depression is caused by a
worry that his wealth is all tied up at sea, claiming that his &quot;ventures
are not in one bottom trusted, nor to one place&quot; and, furthermore, that
his &quot;whole estate&quot; does not depend &quot;upon the fortune of this present
year&quot; (1.1.41-45).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> This latter claim turns out to be mendacious,
however, since he is soon forced to admit to Bassanio that he will have
to borrow the money &quot;to furnish [him] to Belmont, to fair Portia,&quot;
since &quot;all [his] fortunes are at sea&quot; (1.1.177-82). Shylock, whose
business it is to know such things, not only confirms this latter point,
but adds that some of Antonio's &quot;ventures&quot; have already been &quot;squand'red
abroad&quot; (1.3.17-25). The relief which Antonio shows at the end of the
play on hearing that some of his ships have been preserved confirms that
he has in fact been deeply worried about them (5.1.286-88).</p>
<p>But why should Antonio, the eponymous merchant, who makes his living by
trade, seek to deny that he worries about the ships which provide him
with his living? Salerio's assumption that his friend must often be
distracted from his religious devotions by the resemblance between the
&quot;holy edifice of stone&quot; and the rocks upon which his ships could at any
moment founder introduces the idea that there is a tension between
Antonio's faith and his profession (1.1.29-36). I would argue that it is
the merchant's devout Christian belief which impels him to attempt to
cultivate a lofty indifference to the very trade upon which his income
depends. If taken seriously, the lead casket's injunction to &quot;give and
hazard all&quot; requires Christians to eschew any form of self-interest,
including the very need to make a living.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Antonio also emphatically denies that his sadness stems from unrequited
love, exclaiming &quot;Fie, fie!&quot; when Solanio advances this theory (1.1.46).
Here too, however, his denial is immediately brought into question, in
this case by his extreme generosity to Bassanio: &quot;My purse, my person,
my extremest means, lie all unlock'd to your occasion&quot; (1.1.138-39).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>
Although Solanio is mystified by Antonio at this point in the play, he
later becomes convinced that his friend's &quot;embraced heaviness&quot; is
primarily a natural reaction to the prospect of losing Bassanio to
Portia: &quot;I think he only loves the world for him&quot; (2.8.50). If Solanio
is correct, Antonio's refusal to admit to the grief which Bassanio's
plan to embark on &quot;a secret pilgrimage&quot; to win a &quot;lady&quot; has been causing
him is as disingenuous as his denial that he is worried about his ships
(1.1.119-21).</p>
<p>In his friendship with Bassanio, as in his professional life, Antonio
seeks to repress his desire to secure a return. All his friend has to do
is &quot;say&quot; he needs money and Antonio will immediately feel &quot;prest&quot; to
offer him a loan, despite his own financial worries, and despite his
desire to keep Bassanio by his side: &quot;You do me now more wrong in making
question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all I have&quot;
(1.1.155-60). He ignores the fact that Bassanio has not repaid a
previous debt, and is even prepared to borrow the money which his friend
needs from the usurers whom he regularly condemns (1.1.146-47). Far from
insisting that his friend should feel particularly obliged to him,
Antonio never even distinguishes explicitly between these loans and the
credit which he has offered &quot;gratis&quot; to so many of his peers, although
it is clear that he treats Bassanio with particular generosity. It is
left to Bassanio himself to acknowledge the special status of the
relationship and to confirm that it naturally generates ineluctable
obligations: &quot;To you, Antonio, I owe the most in money and in love&quot;
(1.1.130-1).</p>
<p>I would argue that the nebulousness of Antonio's melancholia is
symptomatic of the difficulty of reconciling the Christian injunction
&quot;to give&quot; selflessly &quot;and hazard all&quot; with the natural desire to secure
a return for one's efforts, either in personal or professional life.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>
Just as Antonio cannot acknowledge, perhaps even to himself, that he is
worried about his material &quot;ventures,&quot; so his pious adherence to this
principle prevents him from admitting that he is dreading the loss of
his beloved, and indeed even from allowing this fear to erode in the
slightest degree his noble determination to support Bassanio's pursuit
of Portia. Striving to suppress his natural grief and anxiety in this
way, he succeeds only in transmuting them into a &quot;wear[y]&quot; sense of
futility, which perhaps even verges on nihilism, since he has cut
himself off from the possibility of establishing a truly fulfilling
attachment (1.1.2). His willingness to engage at length in the guessing
game with Salerio and Solanio which this depression provokes is itself a
sign that unremitting self-sacrifice is beyond the scope of human
nature. He perhaps allows himself to relish his interlocutors' obvious
concern for his well-being, since he can reassure himself that he is not
compromising his stance of pious altruism by making direct emotional
demands upon his friends.</p>
<p>Antonio's remark that he &quot;hold[s] the world but as the world...a
stage, where every man must play a part, and mine a sad one,&quot; prompts
Gratiano to offer a third explanation for his depression (1.1.77-78). He
accuses his friend of deliberately cultivating a &quot;willful
stillness...with purpose to be dress'd in an opinion of wisdom, gravity,
profound conceit,&quot; and advises him to &quot;fish not with this melancholy
bait for this fool gudgeon, this opinion&quot; (1.1.88-102). His charge that
Antonio presents himself as &quot;Sir Oracle&quot;-- &quot;when I ope my lips let no
dog bark!&quot;--suggests that his friend's sombre austerity is ultimately an
expression of a pride which has been sublimated by his habitual piety
(1.1.93-94). He implies that Antonio strives to distinguish himself by
conforming rigorously to a faith which tends to value self-sacrifice and
a contemplative life of &quot;mortifying groans&quot; above passionate interaction
(1.1.82). Gratiano's complaint, which seems to spring from his own much
more robust sense of his own needs (see below), is that this stance of
proud austerity prevents Antonio from engaging in the &quot;mirth and
laughter&quot; which promotes &quot;warm&quot; friendships (1.1.79-86). I would suggest
that Shakespeare too takes his bearings by the joys that such
friendships may provide.</p>
<p>Although the apparently humble Antonio of course dismisses this theory
too, there is much evidence that he does indeed strive to distinguish
himself in precisely this way. He doubtless gratifies his pride by
contrasting his own pure faith in &quot;the hand of heaven&quot; and ability to
&quot;produc[e] holy witness&quot; with Shylock's superstition and devilish
corruption of the sacred text (1.3.91-102). His unusually extreme public
condemnation of Shylock's &quot;bargains, and...well-won thrift, which he
calls interest&quot; is doubtless designed to underline his own superiority
to such base acquisitiveness both in his own mind and in the eyes of his
peers, even though in reality he too lives by exploiting his capital
-indeed, even the philanthropic loans by which he hopes to demonstrate
his own boundless generosity must presumably be funded by his
hard-headed commercial ventures (1.3.44-51) The similarity between these
two characters in professional terms is highlighted by the parallel
between Antonio's ultimate admission that his &quot;life&quot; depends on his
&quot;living&quot; and Shylock's final desperate plea: &quot;you take my life when you
do take the means whereby I live&quot; (5.1.286, 4.1.376-77).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> Portia's
initial uncertainty in the courtroom as to &quot;which is the merchant here?
and which the Jew?&quot; seems to underline this parallel (4.1.174).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pursuing the theme of Antonio's pride, we may infer that he introduces
the idea that the bond should contain a harsh punitive clause in order
to ensure that he can continue to condemn Jewish usurers with all his
usual haughtiness, even after being forced to avail himself of their
services (1.3.130-37). He also proudly suppresses his real fears when
Shylock responds by proposing the pound of flesh contract: his repeated
claims that he views this proposition as &quot;kind&quot; are undermined by his
insistent assurances that he expects his ships to return &quot;within these
two months&quot; (1.3.152-59, 1.3.178-81). The reliance which he places on
this expectation--which, as we have seen, is itself less firm than he
pretends--suggests that he is much more worried about the consequences
of reneging on the debt than he acknowledges.</p>
<p>Overall, we may conclude that, as the quintessential Christian in the
play, Antonio exposes the shortcomings of his faith. If taken literally,
Christian teachings are incompatible with the need to make a living, the
desire to win the affection of a beloved, and with the pursuit of
acclaim, precisely because they honour, albeit necessarily in an
unacknowledged way, those who strive to imitate Christ's own entirely
self-sacrificing love.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> Paradoxically, the motive which underlies the
humble self-abnegation of the most devout Christians may thus be a proud
determination to distinguish themselves from their more self-interested
peers. Antonio's wearisome sadness is primarily caused by this
determination, which, crucially, precisely as the insightful Gratiano
indicates, prevents him from forming fulfilling relationships
(1.1.79-99). It is possible that the lead casket principle encourages
self-regard to dominate precisely because it strips attachments of their
normal rewards. Antonio's egregious pride may itself be construed as an
attempt to fill the &quot;weary&quot; void which is left once his faith has
deprived him of the chance to pursue &quot;the joys of heaven here on earth&quot;
through an intimate relationship (3.5.76; see below for an analysis of
this line).</p>
<p>We may deduce Antonio's priorities from the fact that he seems to find
it increasingly difficult to refute the various analyses of his
depression which his friends advance. By contrast to his explicit and
relatively extended rejection of Salerio's imputation of materialism,
his insistence that he is not in love remains implicit, albeit emphatic:
&quot;Fie, fie!&quot; (1.1.41-46). His mocking dismissal of Gratiano's charge of
pride is equally inarticulate, but apparently even more casual-- &quot;It is
that--any thing now!&quot; (1.1.113). However, he must appear visibly shaken
by this latter charge, for Bassanio immediately feels the need to
reassure him that Gratiano &quot;speaks an infinite deal of nothing&quot; -while
acknowledging, perhaps inadvertently, that there are at least &quot;two
grains&quot; of truth in the latter's accusations (1.1.114-18). If the
hierarchy of Antonio's motives may be deduced from the increasing
incoherence and indirectness of these three demurrals, we may infer that
his love overshadows his acquisitiveness, but also that both these
motives are themselves ultimately regulated by a proud self-regard,
which, having been sublimated by his habitual piety, generally manifests
itself as scrupulous self-denial.</p>
<p>Shakespeare outlines the hierarchy of Antonio's priorities in a number
of other ways. Firstly, it should be remembered that from one point of
view the loan is itself a business venture, just as Bassanio argues,
which could--and indeed in the end presumably does--result in the
merchant retrieving not only his principle, but the principle from the
previous loan, plus any recompense which a grateful friend and his
lavishly generous wife might feel moved to bestow on him (1.1.140-52;
see 3.2.299-307). Nevertheless, although Antonio is always more
concerned with profit than he can allow himself to admit, his decision
to finance such a risky venture undoubtedly shows that he prioritises
his love for his friend over his need to make a living. Needless to say,
his willingness to risk forfeiting a pound of his own flesh indicates
that his affection for Bassanio is strong enough to override even his
instinct for self-preservation, let alone his concern with
self-advancement. However, as we have seen, his bold agreement to
Shylock's terms also reflects the pride which he takes in his own
supposedly selfless generosity. We may infer that his overriding motive
is self-regard, albeit of a highly sublimated variety, from the fact
that he continues to show a haughty scorn for the Jew even as he is
requesting the loan, since this intransigent approach could easily have
induced the latter to refuse to provide him with the means to help his
beloved.</p>
<p>Antonio's approach to life turns out to be unsustainable, since, just as
Gratiano maintains, he has deprived himself of the rewards that close
relationships may confer. As the play proceeds, Antonio cannot sustain
his stern effort to repress his longing for Bassanio to return his care.
As he sees his friend off, he reassures him that he must not feel
obliged to &quot;make some speed of his return&quot; from Belmont, urging him
instead to &quot;be merry, and employ [his] chiefest thoughts to courtship&quot;
(2.8.37-45). At the same time, however, the sharp contrast which he
draws between his own subjection to &quot;the Jew's bond&quot; and his friend's
freedom to devote himself to this courtship seems calculated to remind
Bassanio of the unfairness of their relative situations. Subsequently,
his prediction that his friend will be absolved of all material debts
once Shylock has exacted his deadly forfeit appears to be subconsciously
designed to exacerbate his beloved's sense of obligation:</p>
<p>Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel,
my estate is</p>
<p>very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since in paying it, it is
impossible I should</p>
<p>live, all debts are clear'd between you and I, if I might but see you at
my death.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, use your pleasure; if your love do not persuade you to
come, let</p>
<p>not my letter.</p>
<p>(3.2.315-22)</p>
<p>There is a contradiction here between Antonio's initial assurance that
Bassanio's debt will automatically be &quot;clear'd&quot; and the subsequent
conditional clause, which suggests that this remission is dependent on
his return to Venice. By appending his passionate demand loosely to the
main clause in this manner, Antonio is able to underline Bassanio's
obligations with a forcefulness which remains largely unacknowledged. He
then strives to counter any residual impression that he is in fact
calling in a debt by insisting that Bassanio too must present himself as
motivated to return to his side entirely by spontaneous &quot;love,&quot; however
grateful or guilty his beloved might actually feel. In this way Antonio
doubtless imagines that he has eliminated from the relationship any
transactional element which might debase the purity of his altruism,
even as he is in reality appealing powerfully to Bassanio's natural
sense of obligation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, although Antonio's final words in act 3, scene 3-- &quot;Pray God
Bassanio come to see me pay his debt, and then I care not!&quot;--are phrased
simply as a prayer, he no doubt anticipates that this comment, which
underlines the unfairness of their relative positions, will be repeated
to Bassanio by the gossipy Solanio, and that his friend will immediately
feel obliged to do everything he can to repay &quot;his debt&quot; -as indeed he
does (3.3.35-36). Thus, overall, despite appearances, Antonio does
indeed &quot;hazard all he hath&quot; in the hope of securing a return. The
doctrine of &quot;giv[ing] and hazard[ing] all&quot; to which he has been
habituated cannot completely repress his deep need to see his care
requited. We may infer that this conventional doctrine, which demands a
studied altruism, is constantly in danger of being undermined by the
natural urge to &quot;get as much as [one] deserves&quot; (2.7.7).</p>
<p>In the courtroom scene, Antonio continues to deny that he hopes to be
requited by Bassanio for what he presents as an entirely willing
sacrifice: &quot;For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I'll pay it instantly
with all my heart&quot; (4.1.280-81). Again, however, his overt injunctions
to Bassanio not to feel guilty after his death are subverted, not only
by this gruesome pun, but by his insistent references to his beloved's
indebtedness: after enjoining him to &quot;grieve not that I am fall'n to
this for you,&quot; he urges him to &quot;repent but...that you shall lose your
friend,&quot; since he himself &quot;repents not that he pays your debt&quot; (4.1.266,
4.1.278-79). (It should be noted that the only substantial reason which
Antonio offers for his acceptance of death here further undermines his
assumption of unworldliness, since it reminds us of his financial
worries: he expresses a concern that he would otherwise &quot;outlive his
wealth,&quot; and be condemned to the &quot;ling'ring penance&quot; of &quot;an age of
poverty&quot;: 4.1.267-72.) This cocktail of veiled reproaches and apparent
self-abnegation effectively enflames Bassanio's guilt: he would by now
sacrifice &quot;life itself, my wife, and all the world...to deliver&quot; his
friend from Shylock's clutches (4.1.282-87).</p>
<p>I would argue that Antonio also attempts to call in the debt which the
Christian community as a whole owes him for &quot;lend[ing] out money
gratis&quot; (1.3.44). After abandoning his efforts to plead with
Shylock--efforts which reveal that, despite the noble resignation which
he displays during the courtroom scene, in accordance with his principle
that he must transcend all material needs, he does in fact fear
death--he resorts to reminding the community of its obligation to him,
albeit in a characteristically indirect way: he tells Solanio that
Shylock hates him because he has &quot;oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
many that have at times made moan to me&quot; (3.3.3, 3.3.11, 3.3.21-24).
Although he urges the garrulous Solanio to &quot;go&quot; even as he is portraying
himself as passively resigned to his fate, his assertion that &quot;these
griefs and losses have so bated me that I shall hardly spare a pound of
flesh&quot; again seems designed, perhaps subconsciously, to enflame his
friends' guilt and pity (3.3.31-33).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, in the courtroom scene, the more determined he appears to be
&quot;to suffer, with a quietness of spirit...tyranny and rage,&quot; and the more
insistently he urges the court to &quot;make no moe offers, use no farther
means,&quot; presenting himself as a helpless lamb at the mercy of a wolf, or
a &quot;tainted wether of the flock,&quot; the more he provokes the pity and
indignation of his myriad supporters, as Gratiano's savage interjections
demonstrate (4.1.10-13, 4.1.70-83, 4.1.114-16, 4.1.290-92). His
comparison of himself to an uncomplaining lamb about to be slaughtered
is all the more powerful because it is bound to remind a Christian court
of the Crucifixion.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> Antonio's unacknowledged machinations are
really a way of reminding the community of the obligations which his
humility and generosity have created, but they also point to the power
of conventional doctrine to stunt and distort the manner in which the
innate need to &quot;get as much as [one] deserves&quot; may manifest itself,
since they preserve the fiction that he has transcended this need, along
with all other material desires, including even the instinct for
self-preservation.</p>
<p>After being freed by the court, Antonio finally feels emboldened to
demand a more concrete return from his beloved, requiring him to give
his wife an account of his devoted sacrifices, and &quot;bid her be judge
whether Bassanio had not once a love&quot; (4.1.273-77). This apparently
humble request in fact comes close to flaunting the precedence which he
now--correctly, as it turns outs--presumes he must take over Portia in
Bassanio's hierarchy of obligations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> Antonio's natural gratitude to
Balthazar for saving his life is so overwhelming that it finally
threatens to override his usual distaste for anything that smacks of the
transactional: he assures the lawyer that both he and Bassanio &quot;stand
indebted&quot; to him &quot;in love and service...evermore&quot; (4.1.413-14). When the
disguised Portia demands as her reward the ring which she gave to
Bassanio to symbolise their mutual fidelity, Antonio cannot help
interceding: &quot;Let his deservings and my love withal be valued 'gainst
your wive's commandement&quot; (4.1.450-51). Here, although he attempts to
distinguish between his own &quot;love,&quot; which could still be conceived of as
given in a spirit of pure generosity, and Balthazar's more mundane
&quot;deservings,&quot; he comes close to admitting that his self-denying care
naturally generates enormous obligations, and indeed to demanding that
it be &quot;valued&quot; even above what one might have imagined to be Bassanio's
most intimate relationship. However, he is only able to free himself
from his habitual constraints in this particular situation because he is
apparently making this demand purely on Balthazar's behalf. He never
explicitly acknowledges that the value of the lawyer's actions is
actually dictated by the supremely &quot;deserving...&quot; sacrifices of the man
whose life he has saved.</p>
<p>Later, when Bassanio's ceding of the ring becomes the subject of a
marital argument, Antonio again cannot resist highlighting the influence
which he now exerts over his friend, albeit with a decorous appearance
of regret: &quot;I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels&quot; (5.1.238). No
doubt he relishes the task which Portia gives him of acting as &quot;surety&quot;
for Bassanio's fidelity, since it represents an acknowledgement, albeit
made apparently in jest, that his beloved's primary obligation will
always be to himself (4.1.249-56). Overall, Antonio's hypocritical
behaviour in the second half of the play suggests that it is beyond the
scope of human nature &quot;to give and hazard all&quot; without demanding &quot;as
much as [one] deserves.&quot; At the same time, however, the doctrinal
pressure to do so is shown to stunt and distort the natural urge to make
such a demand, thus generating countless unconscious duplicities.</p>
<p>There is no indication in the play that Antonio's one-sided generosity
helps him to establish truly intimate relationships. In the opening
scene his refusal to admit to the frustrated desires which have caused
his depression merely &quot;wearies&quot; Solanio, who is eventually driven to
argue that, if his sadness is indeed as groundless as he says, then he
might as well choose merriment as maintain a &quot;vinegar aspect&quot; (1.1.1-5,
1.1.47-56). Having exerted themselves to help Antonio without success,
Salerio and Solanio abruptly make their escape in this scene, no doubt
with some relief, under the pretext that they are outranked by Bassanio,
Lorenzo and Gratiano (1.1.57-59). Antonio understands very well that
they are simply &quot;embrac[ing] th' occasion to depart,&quot; and attempts to
reassure them that their &quot;worth is very dear in [his] regard&quot;
(1.1.62-64). They are, however, unmoved by this characteristically
veiled attempt to induce them to stay, while at the same time, by
contrast, responding willingly to Bassanio's invitation: &quot;when shall we
laugh?&quot; (1.1.66-68). Lorenzo would also have left at this point, having
arranged to meet with Bassanio &quot;at dinner-time,&quot; had it not been for
Gratiano's lengthy interjection (1.1.69-71). Understandably, no-one asks
Antonio either to dine or to &quot;laugh.&quot; Gratiano, who perhaps uniquely
among Antonio's acquaintances, actually &quot;love[s]&quot; him, is the only one
who promises to continue his conversation with the merchant &quot;after
dinner&quot; (1.1.87, 1.1.103-04). Later we see that Antonio is not involved
in the masque, but busies himself solemnly with his efforts to expedite
Bassanio's departure (2.6.62-66).</p>
<p>In these ways Shakespeare covertly endorses Gratiano's view that the
&quot;opinion&quot; which Antonio fishes for with his &quot;melancholy bait&quot; is a poor
substitute for the warm-blooded interactions which provide genuine
fulfilment (1.1.101-02). Even the admiration of the Christian community,
which Antonio has so diligently courted, can easily tip into mockery:
Solanio, who is, as we have seen, &quot;wearie[d]&quot; by his solemnity, refers
to him at one point as &quot;the good Antonio, the honest Antonio--O that I
had a title good enough to keep his name company&quot; (1.1.2, 1.1.54-56,
3.1.12-14). Salerio and Solanio are not without real concern for their
friend, as we see at the start of the play, but they betray an
impatience with the idealised image which he constantly projects.
Significantly, Solanio only warms to Antonio when the latter allows
himself to vent, in however indirect a manner, the passionate desires
which lurk beneath his pious restraints: the merchant &quot;turn[s] his
face&quot; and &quot;put[s] his hand behind him&quot; to &quot;wr[i]ng Bassanio's hand&quot;
as the latter is departing for Belmont, but in the process of hiding his
grief from his beloved in this typically self-effacing manner, he
inadvertently shows Salerio that his eyes are in fact &quot;big with tears&quot;
(2.8.46-49). It is Salerio's account of this incident which finally
convinces Solanio, who had previously been mystified by the merchant's
obfuscations, that Antonio &quot;only loves the world for&quot; Bassanio, and
inspires him to embark on a compassionate mission to &quot;find him out and
quicken his embraced heaviness with some delight or other&quot; (2.8.50-53).</p>
<p>As noted above, Bassanio himself invites Salerio and Solanio to &quot;laugh&quot;
in the opening scene, and has arranged to have dinner with Gratiano and
Lorenzo, but, unlike Gratiano, makes no such plans to see Antonio in the
future. His remark that he &quot;owe[s] the most in money and in love&quot; to
Antonio could be seen as an inadvertent admission that he is bound to
his friend primarily by his financial obligation, particularly as it is
a prelude to his attempt to borrow more money (1.1.130-52). Rather than
appealing to Antonio as a friend, or even interacting with him with any
degree of spontaneity, he delivers a carefully prepared speech which, as
we have seen, essentially presents the putative loan as a business
venture (1.1.140-76). He subsequently tells Portia that Antonio is &quot;the
dearest friend to me,&quot; but twenty lines later she brings out the
ambiguity of this word: &quot;since you are dear bought, I will love you
dear&quot; (3.2.292, 3.2.313). Just as Gratiano might have predicted,
Antonio's endeavours to be seen as &quot;the kindest man, the best
condition'd and unwearied spirit in doing courtesies,&quot; have merely
secured Bassanio's high &quot;opinion&quot; rather than establishing a truly
intimate connection: Bassanio praises him for possessing more of &quot;the
ancient Roman honor...than any that draws breath in Italy&quot; (1.1.102,
3.2.292-96). This is not to deny that he feels deeply grateful to
Antonio, but only to point out that, in Shakespeare's scheme, true
intimacy must be based on a balanced exchange of such &quot;courtesies.&quot;
Antonio does not see that true friends must show their neediness as well
as their care.</p>
<p>Whereas Antonio strives to practise an unrelenting self-denial, Portia
is self-assertive-- &quot;so is the will of a living daughter curb'd by the
will of a dead father&quot; (1.2.24-25)--and unrestrained: she ignores the
&quot;instructions&quot; of &quot;divine[s],&quot; for &quot;the brain may devise laws for the
blood, but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree&quot; (1.2.12-21). However,
Portia's &quot;blood&quot; and &quot;will&quot; lead her to reject her various suitors for
superficial and stereotypical reasons; the Frenchman because of his
mercurial disposition, the English lord because of his inability to
speak Italian or French and his lack of sartorial elegance, the Scotsman
because of his spirited aggression, and the German because of his
habitual inebriation (1.2.54-91). She dismisses Morocco purely on the
grounds that he has &quot;the complexion of a devil,&quot; whatever his inner
&quot;condition,&quot; and when he chooses the wrong casket, wishes him &quot;a gentle
riddance,&quot; adding, &quot;let all of his complexion choose me so,&quot; regardless
of the fact that he leaves with a &quot;griev'd...heart,&quot; having had to
promise &quot;never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage&quot;
(1.2.129-31, 2.7.76-79, 2.1.41-42). She attempts to dissuade the
thoughtful Arragon from taking the test (see below), and, once he has
failed, facilely criticises his &quot;wisdom&quot; and &quot;wit&quot; (2.9.7-18,
2.9.80-81). Bassanio is no doubt preferred simply because he is
handsome, white and comports himself in a relatively familiar way.</p>
<p>Portia does not even touch on the vital issue of her suitors' constancy.
Since only four of the six suitors abandon their suit as soon as they
learn that they must vow never to marry if they choose the wrong casket,
it is possible that two unspecified lovers--in addition to Morocco and
Arragon--have changed their mind about returning home, and are still
wondering whether to take the test (1.2.100-05, 1.2.123-24; see
2.1.38-42). If so, Portia does not acknowledge their superior
commitment. Far from forcing her to surrender to &quot;fortune,&quot; as Portia
implies, the casket test represents a careful attempt to provide her
with the discrimination which she lacks. It is in fact her own choice
which is arbitrary, since it is based entirely on Bassanio's good looks
and relatively familiar manners, whereas the test might have helped her
to marry a man whose faith promoted unstinting, selfless care, if she
had allowed it run its course (3.2.21).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> Shakespeare perhaps uses
Nerissa's response to Portia's dismissal of Arragon to hint at this
point: &quot;The ancient saying is no heresy, hanging and wiving goes by
destiny&quot; (2.9.82-83). (As we shall see, Nerissa is far from leaving her
own marriage to &quot;destiny.&quot;)</p>
<p>Although Portia affects to believe that it is &quot;a sin&quot; to be &quot;forsworn,&quot;
in reality she subverts the casket test because she sees it as her
&quot;right...&quot; to pursue her desires without constraint (3.2.10-19). No
doubt using knowledge derived from the failures of Morocco and Aragon,
she orders a song to be played which implicitly warns her beloved not to
choose the more superficially attractive caskets, and in which the first
three lines all rhyme with &quot;lead&quot; (3.2.63-72).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> Bassanio's initial
comment makes it clear that he has attended carefully to these clues:
&quot;So may the outward shows be least themselves&quot; (3.2.73).</p>
<p>Arguably, the song which Portia uses to guide Bassanio away from the
gold and silver caskets also inadvertently functions as an ironic
comment on her own situation: after raising the question as to whether
&quot;fancy [is] bred...in the heart or in the head,&quot; the lyric concludes
that it is &quot;engender'd in the eyes,&quot; and therefore &quot;dies in the cradle
where it lies&quot; (3.2.63-72). The corollary is perhaps that in
relationships which move beyond sensual &quot;fancy&quot; the head works alongside
the heart to build and gauge mutual trust through repeated
demonstrations of reciprocal fidelity. Having circumvented her father's
test, which was designed to replicate all the advantages of a prudent
courtship, Portia is in danger of becoming one of the &quot;many&quot; who, in the
words of the poem concealed in the gold casket, have &quot;sold&quot; their &quot;life&quot;
in exchange for &quot;gilded tombs&quot; -although, as we shall see, she herself
takes the principle of &quot;giv[ing] and hazard[ing] all&quot; too seriously
to be classed among the many characters in the play who succumb to the
enticements of the gold casket (2.7.67-69).</p>
<p>Portia's comparison of Bassanio's attempt to solve her father's love
test to Alcides' liberation of Hesione from the sea monster is more
fitting than she knows, for the hero's motive was indeed not love but a
desire to secure a reward (3.2.53-60; see below for a full analysis of
Bassanio's motives). She may not be quite as confident as she seems that
Bassanio has &quot;much more love&quot; than Hercules, since she inadvertently
admits that she will probably view his efforts to solve the riddle of
the caskets &quot;with much, much more dismay&quot; than he that actually
&quot;mak[es] the fray&quot; (3.2.54, 3.2.61-62).</p>
<p>Portia's typically extravagant apostrophe to her own passionate self--
&quot;be moderate, allay thy ecstasy, in measure rain thy joy, scant this
excess&quot;--may thus be taken more seriously than she intends, for she does
not know that Bassanio is capable of sustaining the intimacy which she
assumes will flow from their mutual attraction (3.2.111-14). Unlike
Juliet, who immediately wishes to revoke her accidental confession of
love, or Rosalind, who methodically institutes her own love tests, or
Hermia, who insists that Lysander sleep separately from her after they
have eloped, or Perdita, who worries that Florizel's &quot;resolution cannot
hold,&quot; Portia sees no reason to temper her desire for Bassanio, who she
seemingly agrees is &quot;best deserving a fair lady&quot; simply on the basis of
his appearance and manners (1.2.117-21).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> It is significant that the
level-headed Nerissa berates her mistress for pursuing her desires
indiscriminately, arguing that lasting &quot;happiness&quot; is the preserve of
those who moderate their desires-- &quot;superfluity comes sooner by white
hairs, but competency lives longer&quot; (1.2.7-9)--and maintaining that the
restrictions laid on her by the casket test are designed to ensure that
she &quot;rightly love[s]&quot; (1.2.27-33). The contrast between the imprudent
Portia and the other heroines listed above, all of whom in their
different ways practise a degree of caution and moderation, while
remaining equally insistent on their right to make own choice of
partner, might suggest that in Shakespeare's view freedom in matters of
the heart should ideally be limited to those who are capable of
exercising self-control.</p>
<p>Portia has thoroughly absorbed the idea that it is admirable &quot;to give
and hazard all&quot; for love, as is shown by the extravagance of her wish
that her &quot;virtues, beauties, livings, friends&quot; might &quot;exceed account,&quot;
so that she could &quot;stand high in [Bassanio's] account&quot; (3.2.155-57).
In her impatience to appeal to Bassanio's &quot;fancy,&quot; she dwells
particularly on her desire to be &quot;a thousand times more fair, ten
thousand times more rich,&quot; while reminding her beloved that he will be
the master of &quot;this house, these servants,&quot; and offering him enough
money to repay Antonio's debt twelve times over (3.2.150-54, 3.2.170-71,
3.2.298-308). The very fact that Portia can display her beauty and
material generosity so quickly and easily might remind us that these
qualities are not necessarily useful in promoting the patient exchanges
of care upon which constant attachments are generally founded. Neither
lover can yet trust the other, since neither has &quot;sweat[ed]&quot; to
demonstrate their constancy, as Gratiano is forced to do with Nerissa
(3.2.203-05). We may infer from the fact that Portia makes no further
reference to her &quot;friends&quot; or &quot;virtues&quot; that she does not yet appreciate
that true friendships can only be formed by consistently exercising
&quot;virtues&quot; like wisdom, courage, moderation and justice, all of which
involve restraining one's immediate desires (see 3.2.156). Her
impetuous, lavish offers create an ominous imbalance in the couple's
emotional transactions. Figuring herself as &quot;an unlesson'd girl,
unschool'd, unpractis'd,&quot; she professes a desire to &quot;learn&quot; everything
from &quot;her lord, her governor, her king,&quot; before she has any evidence
that Bassanio is willing or able to teach her anything of true value
(3.2.149-67).</p>
<p>The above argument is by no means intended to imply that Portia would be
incapable of playing her part in a deep and constant intimacy. Indeed,
her insistence on &quot;giv[ing] and hazard[ing] all&quot; encourages her to
show the sort of passionate generosity which tends to catalyse such
intimacies.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup> She succeeds in winning a loyal friend in Jessica,
while Nerissa is clearly devoted to her (3.5.73-83, 3.2.206-08). When
Bassanio learns of the threat to Antonio's life, she immediately
sympathises with him, noting that the letter which he has received
&quot;steals the color from [his] cheek,&quot; and demands that she be allowed
to share his concerns: &quot;I am half yourself, and I must freely have the
half of any thing that this same paper brings you&quot; (3.2.243-50). This
intense sympathy, which soon drives her to undertake the task of saving
Antonio's life, shows that her attraction to Bassanio has already
triggered a deep desire to unite with her beloved. She cannot trust him
fully yet, but she senses that trust may only be established through
diligent, sympathetic care. Portia's fault lies in her easy assumption
that her other &quot;half&quot; will reciprocate her generosity. Qualifying an
earlier point, we may now see that the imperative inscribed on the lead
casket is indeed partly rooted in the innate desire to care for
beloveds; its artificiality consists purely in its insistence that this
care should be unconditional.</p>
<p>As with Antonio, however, the image of unstinting generosity which
Portia projects is misleading, since her various offers are in fact all
attempts, however inadequate and unacknowledged, to set in train what
one might call the transactions of love. She clearly understands this
point herself on some level, since she twice professes a desire to
&quot;stand high in [Bassanio's] account&quot; (3.2.155-57). However,
Shakespeare implies that Portia does not yet appreciate that truly
passionate attachments demand a disciplined reciprocity of care, which
needs to be monitored cautiously in the early stages of a relationship,
precisely because not all beloveds can be relied upon to requite
devotion. Her remark that there must be &quot;an egall yoke of love&quot; and &quot;a
like proportion of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit&quot; between
Antonio and Bassanio, just as she imagines there is between herself and
her beloved, shows a nascent understanding that the exchanges of care
upon which deep intimacies are founded need to be equitable. Ironically,
however, the true similarity between Antonio and Portia is that both
characters are involved in a highly inequitable relationship with their
beloved (3.4.11-18).</p>
<p>As with Antonio, there are hints that the determination to &quot;give and
hazard all&quot; at every turn which distorts Portia's judgement is rooted in
self-love, albeit of a highly sublimated variety. She admits that in
comparing her own &quot;manners&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot; to those of Antonio she has
&quot;come...too near the praising of myself&quot; (3.4.11-23). Like Antonio, she
aspires to a Christ-like generosity of spirit, declaring that she is
determined to &quot;purchas[e] the semblance of my soul...from out the
state of hellish cruelty (3.4.20-21).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup> Although her pride usually
reinforces her habitual efforts to display this generosity, she also
vents it directly at times: she is sure that she will &quot;prove the
prettier fellow&quot; when she and Nerissa are disguised as men, and relishes
the chance to imitate a youth who boasts about his conquests, just as
she clearly enjoys the opportunity to denigrate her foreign suitors
(3.4.60-78). The contrast between Portia's boastfulness and the shame
which Jessica shows when she is forced to disguise herself as a man
suggests that, compared to Judaism and other religions which primarily
value modesty and obedience to a binding set of laws, Christian doctrine
might ultimately have the effect of liberating self-regard as well as
the &quot;blood&quot; (2.6.34-44; see below).</p>
<p>Having said all this, Portia does take some prudent steps to secure at
least a basic return for all her lavish advances. She asks her beloved
&quot;what treason there is mingled with your love,&quot; and then, when he
reassures her, expresses a justifiable worry that &quot;men enforced,&quot;
presumably in this case by sexual and economic motives, might &quot;speak any
thing&quot; (3.2.26-33). She gives Bassanio a ring to symbolise his
constancy, the ceding of which would &quot;presage the ruin of your love, and
be my vantage to exclaim on you,&quot; and at least ensures that he marries
her before she attempts to pay off Antonio's debt (3.2.171-74,
3.2.303-08). Despite her apparent confidence in Bassanio's &quot;manners&quot; and
&quot;spirit,&quot; and in the power of freely given love, Portia thus quite
naturally allows herself to be protected to some extent by social
institutions which have traditionally imposed artificial restrictions on
desire with the aim of reinforcing the innate need for constancy.
However, in a manner that foreshadows the individualism of
post-Christian, liberal regimes (see below), she attaches more
significance to the personal commitment represented by her gift of a
ring than to the sacrament of marriage, which she actually approaches
quite casually-- &quot;First go with me to church and call me wife&quot;--while
even her presentation of the ring is introduced in a relative clause,
appended loosely to a speech which focuses primarily on the fabulous
wealth and power that she is investing in Bassanio (3.2.303,
3.2.167-74).</p>
<p>In the courtroom Portia initially adopts the same lofty approach to
retributive justice as to transactional models of attachment. She
famously informs Shylock that &quot;the quality of mercy is not strain'd, it
droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven&quot; (4.1.184-85). Ultimately, mercy
derives its transcendent value from the fact that &quot;in the course of
justice, none of us should see salvation,&quot; which means that we should
all &quot;pray for mercy, and that same prayer doth teach us all to render
the deeds of mercy&quot; (4.1.199-202). Here Shakespeare exposes the
Christian doctrine which underpins Portia's liberalism<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup>: to allow
love to be regulated by a judgement as to either a culprit's or a
beloved's deserts is to ask more of that individual than Christ himself,
who is presented as responding to fallen humanity with infinite
generosity. These remarks indicate that Portia's passionate generosity,
which seems entirely spontaneous, has in fact been shaped by a habitual
belief in the power of unstinting love to overcome all obstacles. The
sincerity of this belief is evident in the way that she gives Shylock
several chances to show mercy, rather than immediately exposing the flaw
in his case (4.1.182-261).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup> There is no doubt that the liberal ethos
to which Portia has become habituated by her Christian upbringing
exercises a pervasive influence on her approach to relationships.</p>
<p>However, Portia's insistence that mercy should simply be allowed to flow
freely without &quot;strain...,&quot; like the &quot;gentle rain,&quot; is contradicted, not
only by her instruction that Shylock &quot;must...be merciful,&quot; which, as the
Jew himself notes, is phrased as a &quot;compulsion,&quot; but by her subsequent
behaviour, which does indeed implicitly represent mercy as a pressing
obligation (4.1.182-86). Although Portia claims at first that the
reliance of postlapsarian humanity on God's redemptive mercy should
simply &quot;teach&quot; Shylock to &quot;render&quot; mercy, the harsh judgement which she
delivers after he has repeatedly refused to soften his callousness
reflects her underlying conviction that fallen man is in fact dutybound
to strive to emulate Christ's generosity, since he cannot repay Him in
any other way (4.1.233-42, 4.1.260-62, 4.1.321-63). Arguably, in the
Christian scheme, all faults may be humbly forgiven apart from a failure
to show humility and forgiveness.</p>
<p>After implying that she is merely attempting to &quot;teach&quot; Shylock to allow
the &quot;gentle rain&quot; of mercy to flow, Portia thus goes on not only to
punish him for refusing to be merciful, but to impose precisely a
&quot;strain'd&quot; &quot;compulsion&quot; on him to give Antonio half his wealth
(4.1.201-02, 4.1.183-84, 4.1.352-53). Later, she perhaps hopes to gloss
over this inconsistency by asking Antonio himself whether he is willing
to temper the Duke's judgement with mercy; however, it is noticeable
that she then makes no protest against the severe punishments which the
merchant proposes (4.1.378-93).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup> The forfeits which Portia imposes
on Shylock for defaulting on the overarching obligation to be merciful
seem to her perfectly just, although they involve denying him even his
principal: &quot;for, as thou urgest justice, be assur'd thou shalt have
justice more than thou desir'st&quot; (4.1.315-16, 4.1.336-44). Any mercy
that he might be granted must now indeed be thoroughly &quot;strain'd&quot;:
Shylock is first told to kneel &quot;down therefore, and beg&quot; for his life
after Portia's verdict, and then informed that only a display of
&quot;humbleness&quot; might allow him to keep some of his estate
(4.1.363-72).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>In this way, justice is shown to be the irreducible, fundamental
principle from which even Christians themselves ultimately derive their
apparently overriding insistence on the primacy of mercy. Portia
illustrates an inconsistency which, Shakespeare implies, lies at the
heart of Christian doctrine, since, while presenting &quot;salvation&quot; as
transcending &quot;justice,&quot; she naturally feels that it deserves a
proportionate response.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Antonio's behaviour towards Shylock in act 4, scene 1 parallels Portia's
in many ways. The punishment which he demands for Shylock is from one
point of view even harsher than the duke's original sentence, although
it might at first seem to be more merciful: whereas the latter would
have allowed the Jew to maintain complete control over half of his
estate minus a fine, Antonio rescinds the fine, but radically limits
this control, since he insists with an unusually transparent
vindictiveness that Shylock should will all his wealth to &quot;the gentleman
that lately stole his daughter&quot; (4.1.370-90).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup> He refuses to accept
the other half of Shylock's wealth, but offers to keep it &quot;in use,&quot; so
that Lorenzo might receive additional assets after the Jew's death.
(Ironically, this would presumably require further dealings with the
money lenders.) This offer might seem typically generous to the court,
the audience and even to Antonio himself, and indeed it does underline
the seriousness of the merchant's ongoing effort to eschew covetousness,
but on the deepest level I would suggest that it is motivated primarily
by his natural desire to punish Shylock for threatening his life: he
surely understands on some level that the last thing the Jew would want
to do is to reward Lorenzo for eloping with his daughter. It is typical
of Antonio to present what is perhaps his most vindictive demand as an
expression of ardent piety: he requests that Shylock should be forced to
&quot;become a Christian&quot; (4.1.387).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Antonio's natural righteous anger, like his expectation that Bassanio
should show a gratitude commensurate to the care which he has received,
cannot ultimately be suppressed, but is instead disguised and distorted
by his ongoing effort to imitate Christ's selfless love. His sanctions
are more generous than the Duke's only in material terms; in emotional
or spiritual terms his punishment is far more severe than simple justice
would demand. Apparently, the attempt to substitute a passionate, loving
heart for a code of equity may generate all sorts of injustices.</p>
<p>Like Portia, Antonio can doubtless only go as far as he does towards
liberating his natural urge to punish Shylock because he considers the
Jew to be beyond the pale. Right from the start, he eschews any hint of
warmth in his dealings with Shylock, insisting that their transaction
remain coldly functional, just as he imagines Jews would normally wish
it to be: &quot;for when did friendship take a breed for barren metal of his
friend&quot; (1.3.133-34). Quite apart from pointing to the power of religion
to exacerbate tribal tensions (see below), the sharp contrast between
the manner in which Antonio conducts his transaction with Shylock and
the unstinting generosity which he shows Bassanio, and indeed many
others within the Christian community, confirms that the Christian
willingness to &quot;give and hazard all&quot; is, despite appearances, naturally
regulated by an overarching conception of justice. Portia and Antonio
assume that the only true crime is to refuse to imitate Christ's humble
generosity, as Shylock does not only when he demands interest in return
for his loans, but when he asks the court, &quot;What judgment shall I dread,
doing no wrong?&quot; or when he declares that he will &quot;not be made a soft
and dull-ey'd fool to shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield to
Christian intercessors&quot; (4.1.89, 3.3.14-16).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Returning to Portia, we can see that she is as reluctant to admit that
she expects Bassanio to requite her care as she is to acknowledge that
she considers mercy to be a duty. Swayed, no doubt, by her habitual
distaste for anything that smacks of the transactional, Portia initially
wishes to gain nothing in return for her defence of Antonio except for
the satisfaction of having extended her love freely, for &quot;he is well
paid that is well satisfied&quot; and her &quot;mind was never yet...mercenary&quot;
(4.1.415-18). Nevertheless, it is likely that she has been brooding for
a while on her husband's remark that he would give up &quot;life itself, my
wife, and all the world&quot; to free his friend, having initially limited
herself to declaring that his &quot;wife would give [him] little thanks for
that if she were by,&quot; but has been endeavouring to repress her natural
jealousy (4.1.282-89; see 4.1.445-48 for Portia's ambivalence on this
issue). (It is perhaps this partially repressed jealousy which leads her
to insist that Shylock's putative fine should be &quot;for the state, not for
Antonio&quot;: 4.1.373). It is only as an afterthought, and with Bassanio's
own inadvertent prompting, that she decides to test her beloved's
resolve to retain the ring which symbolises his fidelity, yet once she
has released herself from the restraints of her habitual liberalism, she
seems to experience a mounting urge to establish the extent to which her
love is requited: &quot;and now, methinks, I have a mind to it&quot; (4.1.427-33).
As in the courtroom, her innate sense of justice ultimately overrides
her adherence to the conventional principle of &quot;giv[ing] and
hazard[ing] all.&quot;</p>
<p>Portia's punishment of Bassanio for underrating her &quot;virtue&quot; and
&quot;worthiness&quot; in ceding the ring, although presented as a jest, and
consisting of threats which ultimately remain unfulfilled, in fact
represents a serious effort to show him that he is now involved in a
solemn contract, where there might be severe consequences for any
failure to live up to his obligations (5.1.199-200). Not only would she
&quot;ne'er come in [his] bed,&quot; but she would behave as &quot;liberal[ly]&quot; as
she affects to imagine Bassanio has towards the recipient of the ring:
just as Bassanio has apparently preferred this &quot;doctor&quot; to herself, so
she would deny the doctor neither her &quot;body nor [her] husband's bed&quot;
(5.1.189-91, 5.1.223-33). Portia is at last behaving naturally as she
instigates her own love test, censures Bassanio for failing it, and then
threatens to retaliate. These threats show again that, although
Christians are encouraged to feel that they can dispense with
retributive justice, they instinctively fall back upon it whenever the
informal imperatives of love in which they place such faith are not
respected. As Shylock maintains, if a Christian is wronged, &quot;what is his
humility? Revenge&quot; (3.1.68-69).</p>
<p>As with Antonio, however, Portia's adherence to the central Christian
injunction to show unconditional love prevents her from employing any
direct, timely or indeed adequate means of ensuring that her love is
requited. Her imagined punishment itself reflects her liberal values in
a manner that weakens the gravitas which she is trying to assume in
order to rebuke Bassanio: Portia has no right to reprimand Gratiano for
speaking &quot;grossly&quot; when he exclaims at apparently being &quot;cuckold[ed]&quot;
before consummating his marriage, for it is she who introduced this
idea, even if she avoided the indelicate phrase (5.1.265-66). She no
doubt manages to avoid thinking of herself as adopting what she would
see as a basely transactional approach to her marriage by ultimately
presenting her own belated love test as a jest. The bantering manner in
which she asks Antonio to stand as &quot;surety&quot; for Bassanio's fidelity no
doubt allows her to avoid admitting to herself that her husband will
always feel bound to prioritise his friend's demands over her own
(4.1.254-56).</p>
<p>In sum, Shakespeare's implication is that Portia has trusted too much to
the informal imperatives of love, presumably proceeding on the naive
assumption that fellow Christians are bound to value unstinting
generosity. If she had not circumvented her father's love test in the
first place, she might never have married a man who does not love her,
and whose &quot;prodigal&quot; behaviour has left him so thoroughly indebted to
Antonio. Even subsequently, she could have exerted herself much more
forcefully to impress upon Bassanio the seriousness of their marital
contract. Overall, Shakespeare shows through Portia's relationship with
Bassanio that the effort to &quot;give and hazard all&quot; ultimately tends to
endanger the exchanges of care upon which trusting attachments must be
founded. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Portia's wilfulness is underpinned by a secularised version of the lead
casket injunction, which perhaps foreshadows the prevailing ethos of
modern liberal regimes. The restrictions which her father attempted to
place on her desires, which might have ensured that she &quot;rightly
love[d],&quot; are themselves weakened by their reliance on a principle
which celebrates freely given love rather than self-restraint
(1.2.30-33). She differs from Antonio in that she ignores the
&quot;instructions&quot; of &quot;divine[s],&quot; yet, as her celebration of Christian
mercy implies, resembles him in her sincere adherence to the principle
of &quot;giv[ing] and hazard[ing] all,&quot; which not only encourages her to
give herself impetuously to Bassanio in the first place, but
subsequently impedes her natural efforts to ensure that her generosity
is requited (1.2.12-21).</p>
<p>Thus, Shakespeare hints that, both in its traditional and its modern,
secularised form, the central Christian teaching tends to disrupt
attachments. The elliptical nature of the inscription on the lead casket
is itself significant: whereas &quot;hazard[ing]&quot; is normally undertaken
for some ulterior purpose, sincere Christians must love unconditionally.
Both Portia and Antonio form an inequitable relationship with Bassanio
precisely because they have absorbed this teaching. Antonio interprets
it to mean that he should care for Bassanio while suppressing his own
passionate needs, while Portia, trusting entirely to her individual
&quot;will&quot; and &quot;blood,&quot; simply assumes on the basis of very little evidence
that if she provides for her beloved with sufficient generosity, he will
respond in kind.</p>
<p>The parallels between the two characters are highlighted by the way in
which they both complain of &quot;wear[iness]&quot; in their opening lines
(1.1.1-2, 1.2.1-2). They are also rebuked in a similar way by Nerissa
and Gratiano respectively, who both argue that their depression stems
from an egregious self-regard (1.1.79-102, 1.2.3-9). Shakespeare uses
Gratiano in particular to hint that the self-regard of serious
Christians, and, one might add, of post-Christian liberals, may be
sublimated by their habitual beliefs in a manner that stunts their
capacity to form fulfilling attachments.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup> It is significant that the
only two characters in the play who strive to adhere to the doctrine of
unconditional love are shown to be in danger of lapsing into an ennui
which perhaps verges on nihilism.</p>
<p>The ennui is a sign that the lead casket imposes impossible demands. As
a result, it cannot maintain its coherence, but tends to dissolve into
the silver. Both Portia and Antonio deliver a form of retribution rather
than mercy in the courtroom, and both eventually attempt, however
inadequately, to &quot;get as much as [they] deserve...&quot; from Bassanio. It
is not surprising that Christian principles tend ultimately to lose
their coherence in this way, for while the silver casket is as deeply
rooted in innate desire as the gold, the leaden injunction to give in a
spirit of pure altruism is primarily conventional. (To the extent that
it is natural, it could be said to abstract the innate urge to make
generous advances in order to initiate intimate attachments from the
reciprocal interactions which ultimately secure such attachments.)
Nevertheless, while Portia and Antonio's efforts to gain a return for
their devotion confirm that it is impossible to dispense entirely with a
transactional model of relationships, the inadequacy of these efforts
indicates that conventional beliefs nevertheless have the power to stunt
and radically distort the equitable exchanges of care upon which deep
attachments must be founded. Both these characters seem fated to
oscillate perpetually between the lead casket and the silver.</p>
<h1>The Gold Casket: to &quot;Gain What Many Men Desire&quot;</h1>
<p>The portrayal of the Prince of Morocco indicates that the gold casket
symbolises self-love and immoderate sensuality. Before choosing the gold
casket, Morocco boasts of the superior intensity of his passion compared
to &quot;creature[s] northward born;&quot; of his attractiveness in the eyes of
&quot;the best-regarded virgins of our clime;&quot; of his Herculean valour; and
of his &quot;birth...fortunes...graces, and...qualities of breeding&quot;
(2.1.1-11, 2.1.24-35, 2.7.32-33). He rejects the lead and silver caskets
purely because the metals are comparatively &quot;base&quot; (2.7.49-55). In
contrast with Arragon, his passion and ambition are actively reinforced
by the reflection that &quot;all the world desires&quot; Portia (2.7.38-47;
compare 2.9.31-33). Quite apart from his urge &quot;to kiss this shrine, this
mortal breathing saint,&quot; his focus on &quot;see[ing]&quot; and &quot;view[ing]&quot;
Portia hints that his love is primarily sensual (2.7.39-47; see below).
His self-regard appears to have flourished freely in the absence of the
restraints of an organised religion -we learn that he has resisted
Islamic invaders on several occasions (2.1.24-26). Whereas the lead and
silver caskets represent instilled codes of behaviour--although, as we
have already seen, the impulse to &quot;get as much as [one] deserves&quot; is
also innate--the gold casket symbolises precisely the self-regarding and
sensual elements within human nature which these codes generally seek to
sublimate or restrain.</p>
<p>Launcelot seems to epitomise the life style represented by the gold
casket. Flushed with success after being hired by Bassanio, he boasts of
his extraordinary abilities and of his multiple sexual escapades:
&quot;fifteen wives...Aleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for
one man&quot; (2.2.156-67). Later, he implicitly absolves himself of any
responsibility for impregnating a woman who is identified only as &quot;the
Moor&quot; (3.5.37-42). The injunction to &quot;give and hazard all&quot; only affects
him to the extent that it side-lines the ten commandments and liberates
his self-love and sensual desire. It is fitting that his namesake was a
Christian knight who was famous for his intemperance.</p>
<p>His mockery of Shylock's simple faith in premonitions implies that,
unlike his master, he does not believe in an immanent God who guides the
virtuous, and perhaps punishes sinners in this world as well as the
next: &quot;it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black
Monday last at six a' clock i' th' morning, falling out that year on Ash
We'n'sday&quot; (2.5.16-27). Like many of his peers, his faith exerts no
visible constraints on his conduct, and in fact amounts to little more
than a proud sense of his Christian identity, which encourages him to
stigmatise all those whom he imagines to be beyond the reach of
salvation (see for instance 2.2.1-32, 3.5.1-26). The faithless Launcelot
respects no code of duty which might restrain his self-regard. Although
he claims to have been &quot;famish'd in [Shylock's] service,&quot; he does not
argue with his former master's subsequent assertion that he has
&quot;gurmandize[d]&quot; with him (compare 2.2.106-07, 2.5.3-4). According to
Shylock, he is &quot;a huge feeder, snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by
day more than the wild-cat&quot; (2.5.46-48). He seems to have served Shylock
&quot;merr[ily]&quot; and &quot;kind[ly] enough&quot; while he considered that it was in
his interest to do so, but has been enticed away by his overmastering
desire to gain one of Bassanio's &quot;rare new liveries&quot; (2.3.1-3, 2.5.46,
2.2.107-11). As soon as he knows he is leaving Shylock, he feels free to
defy his old master's &quot;bidding,&quot; while even after he has taken up his
new post Lorenzo has to command him four times to &quot;prepare dinner&quot;
before he obeys (2.5.6-9, 3.5.46-70).</p>
<p>Shakespeare hints that the fragmentation of Venetian society which
Launcelot seems to embody is endemic and self-perpetuating. Launcelot's
father does not know where Shylock's house is, or indeed whether his son
still works there, let alone how well his master and he &quot;agree&quot;
(2.2.39-47, 2.2.99-101). Enough time has elapsed since Old Gobbo last
saw Launcelot for him to be unsure whether his son is &quot;alive or dead,&quot;
and to believe that his beard may have grown as long as a horse's tail
(2.2.60-72, 2.2.93-99). There is a suggestion that Gobbo himself has
previously been distracted from his domestic commitments by various
sexual affairs, just as Launcelot himself refuses to take responsibility
for his child (2.2.16-18, 3.5.37-42). We may infer that Launcelot has
been deprived of the enduring family relationships which might have
encouraged him to prioritise his attachments over his self-regard. As he
himself protests, it is unlikely that he has really supported his father
in the way that Gobbo claims (perhaps sentimentally, when under the
impression that his son is &quot;deceas'd&quot;): &quot;Do I look like a cudgel or a
hovel-post, a staff, or a prop?&quot; (2.2.60-69). These indignant questions
suggest that his self-regard could never allow him to reduce himself so
far as to play the humble role of dutiful son. The cruel jest in which
Launcelot convinces his father that he is dead is only the clearest of
several indications that the relationship between the two is by no means
deeply affectionate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even Launcelot is not completely alienated from all
attachments, or from the imperatives which they naturally impose. His
pretence that he is dead seems to be a way of punishing Gobbo for his
neglect, as is suggested by his remark that &quot;murder cannot be hid long;
a man's son may, but in the end truth will out&quot; (2.2.78-80). He may
indeed consider that this trick delivers a form of poetic justice, since
it depends on Gobbo's inability to recognise his own son's voice. After
he has punished his father for his long absences, albeit only in this
bantering manner, he feels moved to kneel and ask for his blessing
(2.2.78-98). We may infer from the fact that Gobbo mistakes his son's
hair for his beard that Launcelot's feelings run sufficiently deep to
keep him kneeling for a while even after being told to &quot;stand up.&quot;</p>
<p>Gobbo himself also seems to have been belatedly swayed by a desire to
engage in the exchanges of care which nurture attachments: he presumably
procures a peace offering in the shape of &quot;a dish of doves&quot; for his
son's employer with the aim of re-establishing a paternal relationship
which has previously been fragile and sporadic (2.2.135-36). There is
real concern in his repeated questions regarding Launcelot's
relationship with his employer: &quot;How dost thou and thy master
agree...How 'gree you now?&quot; (2.2.99-101). Perhaps, ironically, his loss
of sight has enabled him to see the insubstantiality of the
gratifications afforded by self-love and sensual attraction, which, as
we shall see, the play regularly associates with superficial
appearances.</p>
<p>However, the disruption which Old Gobbo's former lack of &quot;honest[y]&quot;
has caused is not so easily rectified: the dish of doves which he
brings--for which incidentally he is never thanked by his graceless
son--cannot atone for paternal neglect; nor can the trick which
Launcelot plays on his father deliver proportionate retribution for this
neglect. Although Launcelot asks for Gobbo's blessing in a
straightforwardly affectionate manner, he is &quot;glad&quot; to see him primarily
because his presence and the gift which he has brought might help him to
gain the &quot;rare new liver[y]&quot; which he craves (2.2.107-12). Launcelot
cannot bring himself to respond trustingly to his father's loving
advances, as is shown by the way in which he &quot;becomes embroiled with him
in a contest over how to sue for Bassanio's favor,&quot; even after the two
have apparently become reconciled (2.2.119-41).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup> He interrupts
partly because he is so impatient to advance himself, and partly because
he cannot allow himself to be reduced to the status of &quot;a poor boy&quot; -it
is telling that, rather than welcoming his father's sympathetic concern,
he merely bridles proudly at this affectionate diminutive (2.2.122-24).</p>
<p>In sum, Launcelot and Gobbo's gestures towards reprisal and expiation
respectively are not sufficient to clear the way for a thoroughly
trusting and harmonious relationship, based on a humble exchange of
care, since they are not proportionate to the neglect which originally
disrupted the relationship. Both Gobbo and Launcelot are ultimately
victims of a doctrine which has liberated desire and self-love from any
conventional restraint, while at the same time suggesting that faults
which are in reality deeply divisive may easily be forgiven.</p>
<p>Bassanio inadvertently reveals that he shares Morocco's priorities when
he describes Portia as &quot;richly left, and...fair&quot; before mentioning her
&quot;wondrous virtues&quot; (1.1.161-63). He is certainly attracted to her, even
if his main motive for courting her is financial. His comparison of her
&quot;sunny locks&quot; to a &quot;golden fleece&quot; is the first of several remarks which
link sexual desire to the gold casket (1.1.169-70). Portia is surely
correct to assume that the inscription on this casket, &quot;Who chooseth me
shall gain what many men desire,&quot; refers, at least in part, to physical
attraction: the song by which she hopes to steer Bassanio towards
choosing the lead casket implicitly identifies the gold casket with a
superficial &quot;fancy&quot; that is merely &quot;engend'red in the eyes, with gazing
fed&quot; (2.9.24, 3.2.63-69). Ironically, after prudently rejecting the
charms of &quot;crisped snaky golden locks&quot; in accordance with this hint, and
thus successfully negotiating the casket test, Bassanio himself proceeds
to feed his &quot;fancy&quot; in precisely the manner which the song criticises by
admiring the &quot;golden mesh&quot; of Portia's hair, as represented in the
portrait concealed within the lead casket (3.2.88-102, 3.2.120-23). His
concentration on physical appearance again links him to Morocco, who, as
we have seen, implies that he has been drawn to Belmont primarily by his
longing &quot;to see,&quot; and again &quot;to view fair Portia&quot; (2.7.41-47).</p>
<p>Bassanio then focuses on the way in which the eyes of this &quot;shadow,&quot; or
&quot;counterfeit&quot; of Portia, which he describes as beautiful enough to have
blinded the artist, seem to &quot;move...riding on the balls of mine&quot;
(3.2.115-18, 3.2.124-29). The imagery used in this passage is strongly
reminiscent of <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>: both plays suggest that
sensual desire itself actively invests the physical appearance of the
beloved with a magical charm, which can easily blind lovers to the fact
that, when considered soberly, such appearances are merely inert
&quot;counterfeit[s]&quot; or &quot;shadow[s],&quot; which may be denigrated as abruptly
as they are elevated by the whim of sensual &quot;fancy&quot; (see 3.2.67-69). It
should be noted at this point that Portia's own desire, like that of the
charmed Demetrius and Lysander, is also &quot;with gazing fed&quot;: she initially
provokes Bassanio's interest by delivering &quot;fair speechless messages&quot;
with her &quot;eyes,&quot; and then later describes his &quot;eyes&quot; as having
&quot;o'erlook'd...and divided&quot; her, so that she is &quot;one half...yours, the
other half yours&quot; (1.1.163-64, 3.2.14-16). The lovers have had little
time either to pledge or to demonstrate their mutual fidelity, but are
simply attracted by each other's good looks -and, in Bassanio's case, as
we shall see, not even primarily by those.</p>
<p>Like the image of the golden fleece which runs throughout the play, the
gold casket clearly represents the pursuit of wealth and status as well
as sensual attraction (1.1.167-76; see also 3.2.241 and the analysis of
5.1.12-14 below). Together, social status and physical beauty seem to
form the two central elements which make up the superficial &quot;outside&quot;
which &quot;many a man his life hath sold&quot; merely to &quot;behold&quot; (2.7.67-68). As
with Morocco, but by contrast with Arragon, Bassanio's desire for Portia
is reinforced by the reflection that the &quot;wide world&quot; knows of her
worth, so that &quot;from every coast renowned suitors&quot; pursue her &quot;sunny
locks,&quot; which &quot;hang on her temples like a golden fleece&quot; (1.1.167-70).
His pursuit of Portia combines sensual desire and worldly ambition in a
manner that perfectly illustrates the pervasive influence of the gold
casket.</p>
<p>Similarly, the spectacular and &quot;costly&quot; appearance of Bassanio's train
when he first comes to Belmont provides the quintessential example in
the play of &quot;glister[ing]&quot; without being &quot;gold,&quot; since he later has to
inform Portia that he has &quot;nothing,&quot; and then, later still, and even
more reluctantly, that he was &quot;a braggart&quot; even in making this claim,
since he is in fact in debt to his friend (2.9.86-95, 2.7.65,
3.2.252-63). (Presumably he was initially hoping to pay Antonio back
without even mentioning the debt to Portia, once he was married.) One
may infer that there is a tension between what one might broadly term
gold casket motives and sincere relationships both from Bassanio's
warning to the passionate and outspoken Gratiano &quot;to allay with some
cold drops of modesty [his] skipping spirit,&quot; lest he &quot;be
misconst'red&quot; in Belmont &quot;and lose [his] hopes,&quot; and from the latter's
satirical response, which is to reassure him that he will behave with as
smoothly hypocritical an appearance of piety and &quot;civility&quot; as his
friend could wish (2.2.180-97).</p>
<p>Bassanio needs money primarily to satisfy his desire to distinguish
himself: he has &quot;disabled [his] estate, by something showing a more
swelling port than [his] faint means would grant continuance&quot;
(1.1.123-25).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup> Unlike Antonio, whose self-love is always mediated by
his piety, the pride which Bassanio feels after succeeding in the casket
test is raw and unvarnished: he compares his exultant state of mind to
that of a competitor in a game who has won &quot;applause and universal
shout&quot; and &quot;peals of praise&quot; (3.2.141-45). After briefly mentioning his
&quot;blood,&quot; or sexual desire, he returns to this theme, comparing the
&quot;wild...of joy&quot; which he is experiencing to a &quot;buzzing pleased
multitude&quot; celebrating the speech of a &quot;beloved prince&quot; (3.2.175-83).
Although Bassanio is sufficiently prudent to choose the lead casket, in
reality he is bent on gaining &quot;what many men desire,&quot; namely sexual
pleasure and the status which wealth provides.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup> It is relevant to
note at this point that Bassanio's name may be derived from the word
&quot;base.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ultimate futility of worldly ambition and immoderate sensual desire
is symbolised by the death's head which confronts Morocco when he opens
the gold casket, and underlined by the poem contained therein, which
declares that &quot;many a man his life has sold but my outside to behold.
Gilded tombs do worms infold&quot; (2.7.62-69). Similarly, Portia's song
reminds us that a &quot;fancy&quot; which is purely &quot;engend'red in the eyes, with
gazing fed...dies in the cradle where it lies&quot; (3.2.67-70). Thus,
Shakespeare indicates that the gratifications which are the object of
such fancies are insubstantial and ephemeral. Bassanio himself
inadvertently suggests that his concentration on sensual desire is
ultimately self-destructive, when he compares Portia's hair to a &quot;golden
mesh,&quot; designed &quot;t'entrap the hearts of men faster than gnats in
cobwebs&quot; (3.2.120-123).</p>
<p>Yet Bassanio's subsequent behaviour implies that the sense of duty which
springs naturally from the desire to gain the substantial gratifications
afforded by deep attachments may often prove sufficiently powerful to
counter the insistent promptings of self-regard. Thus, he feels obliged
to interrupt his celebration of his successful completion of the casket
task with a promise to requite Portia's constancy (3.2.183-85). Later,
he declares that he would rather buy Balthazar &quot;the dearest ring in
Venice&quot; than surrender her ring, which he has vowed neither to &quot;sell,
nor give, nor lose&quot; (4.1.434-443). In the last act, he seriously
contemplates &quot;cut[ting his] left hand off&quot; for a moment and
&quot;swear[ing he] lost the ring defending it,&quot; before resorting to
repeated apologies and assurances that he will &quot;never more...break an
oath with thee&quot; (5.1.187-248). The vehemence of this aside suggests that
his desire to requite Portia's generous care is absolutely sincere. We
may infer that by the end of the play Bassanio is moved by a genuine
sense of gratitude and a longing to form a trusting relationship as well
as by self-love and physical desire.</p>
<p>Similarly, in his relationship with Antonio, Bassanio's self-love is
from the start moderated by a heartfelt sense of obligation
(1.1.130-01). Indeed, his pursuit of Portia is itself partly motivated
by a sincere wish to repay his friend for an earlier loan (1.3.146-52).
The sincerity of Bassanio's care for Antonio is shown by his horrified
reaction to Shylock's proposed contract: &quot;You shall not seal to such a
bond for me, I'll rather dwell in my necessity&quot; (1.3.154-55). On the one
hand this intervention is sufficiently forceful to have brought the
whole matter to an end if Antonio were less determinedly generous, but
on the other his desire to regain his former status ultimately overrides
his guilt: his final caution to Antonio is in fact relatively weak -&quot;I
like not fair terms and a villain's mind&quot; (1.3.179).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup> Right from the
start, Bassanio is thus caught uneasily between his desire to &quot;gain what
many men desire&quot; and his feeling that he should give Antonio &quot;as much as
he deserves.&quot;</p>
<p>Bassanio is intensely alarmed when he hears that Antonio's life is in
danger: to Portia he looks as if he has received news of &quot;some dear
friend dead&quot; (3.2.243-47). He tells her that the letter contains &quot;a few
of the unpleasant'st words that ever blotted paper,&quot; adding that &quot;every
word in it [is] a gaping wound issuing life-blood,&quot; since it informs
him that the man who has been his &quot;kindest&quot; and &quot;dearest friend&quot; is in
danger (3.2.250-52, 3.2.265-66, 3.2.292). Again, his guilt and heartfelt
concern are clearly rooted in a natural urge to requite the self-denying
care of such a friend. Throughout the trial scene Bassanio is desperate
to protect Antonio from harm, promising that &quot;the Jew shall have my
flesh, blood, bones, and all, ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of
blood,&quot; and later that he &quot;will be bound to pay [the debt] ten times
o'er, on forfeit of [his] hands...head [and] heart&quot; (4.1.112-13,
4.1.209-12). He offers to sacrifice &quot;life itself, my wife, and all the
world&quot; in return for Antonio's life, and at his friend's behest
eventually gives away the ring which he had promised to cherish forever
(4.1.282-87, 4.1.449-54). (It is significant also that, having promised
to sleep in &quot;no bed&quot; and eschew all &quot;rest&quot; until he returns to Belmont,
he in fact stays for a night at Antonio's house before departing in the
morning: 3.2.324-27, 4.1.454-57). As Bassanio himself puts it later, he
feels &quot;enforc'd&quot; to give up the ring: &quot;beset with shame and courtesy, my
honor would not let ingratitude so much besmear it&quot; (5.1.216-19). This
sort of &quot;honor&quot; has nothing to do with a desire to show &quot;a swelling
port,&quot; but rather refers to the duties that arise naturally from
attachments, which demand that, wherever possible, friends must strive
to requite each other's care in order to earn a trusting relationship.</p>
<p>The story of Lorenzo parallels that of Bassanio, rather as Portia's
story parallels that of Antonio. He too benefits from Shylock's gold and
advances himself in a manner that is both unscrupulous and duplicitous
(2.4.29-31, 3.1.83-87, 3.1.108-112, 2.6.23). He too mentions his
prospective wife's wealth before lauding her virtues, and praises her
beauty before her &quot;tru[th]&quot; (2.4.31-34, 2.6.54-55). He too has little
opportunity to court her before they are married, which means that, like
Bassanio and Portia, neither he nor Jessica have the chance to prove
their constancy or gauge that of their partner. Jessica, who at first
hardly recognises her beloved's voice, can only claim that she loves
no-one else &quot;so much,&quot; adding &quot;who knows but you, Lorenzo, whether I am
yours?&quot; (2.6.26-31).</p>
<p>The shallowness of the couple's initial attachment is suggested by the
very fact that Lorenzo is late for his rendezvous with Jessica. Salerio
and Gratiano understand that, although it would normally be a &quot;marvel&quot;
that Lorenzo should &quot;out-dwell...his hour, for lovers ever run before
the clock,&quot; in this case their friend's sexual desire has already been
thoroughly sated: &quot;Who riseth from a feast with that keen appetite that
he sits down?&quot; (2.6.2-19). Lorenzo's delay also suggests that he has had
to remind himself sternly of the financial rewards which are at stake in
order to overcome his distaste for a plan that involves not only
accepting a Jew as his father, but marrying a woman whom he cannot yet
love, while at the same time &quot;play[ing] the thie[f]&quot; (2.6.22-25).
(Although Lorenzo habitually sees Shylock as &quot;a faithless Jew,&quot; who is
beyond the moral pale, this remark implies that he is nevertheless still
troubled by a natural sense of justice even as he prepares to steal his
gold and jewels: 2.5.37.)</p>
<p>The attentive reader may appreciate the symbolic significance of Jessica
passing Lorenzo a &quot;casket&quot; which she describes as &quot;worth the
pains&quot;--presumably because it contains not only ducats but some of the
treasure which they subsequently squander on their honeymoon--and then
announcing that she will &quot;gild [her]self with some moe ducats&quot;
(2.6.33, 2.6.49-50; see 3.1.83-85, 3.1.108-09, 3.1.118-19).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup> At this
point in the play, the couple perfectly represent both aspects of the
gold casket, since they are motivated simultaneously by sexual desire
and self-advancement. Jessica is primarily driven by her ambition to
&quot;become a Christian,&quot; while Lorenzo is essentially exploiting her desire
to bribe her way into the Christian community by &quot;gild[ing]&quot; herself
with ducats (2.3.22, 2.6.49-50). At the same time, Gratiano and Salerio
imply that a strong sexual attraction has played its part, since they
assume that the couple have already found a way of sleeping together
(2.6.5-19).</p>
<p>As with Bassanio, however, Lorenzo's self-love is naturally tempered by
gratitude. As soon as he sees that Jessica is determined to execute the
couple's nefarious plan, he vows to place her in his &quot;constant soul,&quot;
since she is &quot;wise...fair...and true...as she hath proved herself&quot;
(2.6.52-57). Ironically, Lorenzo's self-love ultimately places him under
obligations which he can only fulfil by practising a degree of
self-denial. Later, after implicitly acknowledging that he must lead an
&quot;upright&quot; life if he wishes to win Jessica's love, he first compares
himself to Troilus sighing for Cressida and then carefully orchestrates
what he hopes will be a romantic scene in order to advance the couple's
intimacy, encouraging Jessica to gaze at the stars to the accompaniment
of music (3.5.73-84, 5.1.1-6, 5.1.53-65). These efforts suggest that his
gratitude and attraction to Jessica have triggered a genuine longing to
transform what was at first essentially a marriage of convenience into a
trusting and intimate attachment.</p>
<p>However, the marriage is riven by a deep mutual mistrust: the analogy
which Lorenzo draws between himself and Troilus, &quot;sigh[ing]&quot; for his
beloved hints at a worry that his new wife might prove to be as fickle
as Cressida was in &quot;the Grecian tents,&quot; now that he has given her access
to a more liberal culture (5.1.1-6). Lorenzo must know that Jessica's
elopement with him was primarily motivated by her ambition to &quot;become a
Christian,&quot; rather than by a wish to be his &quot;loving wife (2.3.22). Even
the gratitude which he feels to her for &quot;prov[ing] herself to be
&quot;true&quot; in carrying through their unscrupulous plan is countered by the
reflection that she only did so by &quot;steal[ing] from the wealthy Jew&quot;
(2.6.55, 5.1.14-17). His fundamental distrust of Jessica is shown by his
quick assumption that the sadness which she feels in response to &quot;sweet
music&quot; might be a sign that she is only &quot;fit for treasons, stratagems
and spoils&quot; (5.1.69, 5.1.83-88). <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>In reality, the coolness that Lorenzo has sensed in Jessica is
symptomatic of an inner unease. She compares her anxiety to that of
Thisbe when she &quot;did...fearfully o'ertrip the dew, and saw the lion's
shadow ere himself, and ran dismayed away&quot; (5.1.6-9). This analogy not
only implies that she loves Lorenzo, but amounts to an appeal for his
patient care. Pained by her recalcitrance, however, Lorenzo retaliates
by indirectly threatening to desert her in favour of his own race,
leaving Jessica begging for him to return, just as Dido repeatedly
beckoned to the patriotic Aeneas as he departed from Carthage
(5.1.9-12). Whereas this analogy undoubtedly implies that the couple's
cultural differences reinforce their divisions, what follows shows that
these differences are not the underlying cause of their rift.</p>
<p>Jessica finally raises the central issue which divides the couple
through her comparison of herself to Medea, &quot;gather[ing] the enchanted
herbs that did renew old Aeson&quot; (5.1.12-14). In the legend, Medea agrees
to use her powers to restore Jason's father, Aeson, to his youth,
because she now regrets the callousness which she displayed towards her
own father, Aeetes in helping her lover to steal the golden fleece.
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup> The bitter remorse which this allusion exposes is a sign that
Jessica cannot ultimately repress her instinctive appreciation of what
is due to those who have cared for her. She has hitherto striven to
ingratiate herself with her new friends--this probably explains her
eager endorsement of Salerio's stigmatising of Shylock as &quot;keen and
greedy&quot; when the couple first arrive in Belmont (3.2.274-90)--but as the
play goes on, she shows a pervasive and potentially divisive unease:
like Thisbe, she starts at shadows, while &quot;sweet music&quot; simply reminds
her of the harmonious state of mind which she has forfeited (5.1.6-9,
5.1.69).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lorenzo's response shows that he understands that in comparing herself
to Medea Jessica is alluding to the crime which the couple perpetrated
against Shylock. However, whereas Jessica's reference to the legend
implies that she wishes to confront this crime and perhaps, like Medea,
try to atone for it in some way, Lorenzo strives to distance himself
from his own guilt and to avoid any reproaches for &quot;playing the
thie[f],&quot; by reminding her that it was after all primarily she who
&quot;did...steal from the wealthy Jew, and with an unthrift love did run
from Venice, as far as Belmont&quot; -although he manages to soften this
attack by appearing to use the phrase &quot;steal from&quot; metaphorically,
merely to refer to her secretive elopement (2.6.22, 3.5.83-90,
5.1.14-17). On her part, although Jessica also disguises her true
meaning in exactly the same way, she finally responds angrily to his
apparently bantering accusations, meting out precisely the reproaches
which her husband sought to avoid: she accuses Lorenzo of &quot;stealing her
soul with many vows of faith, and ne'er a true one&quot; (5.1.17-20).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup>
Thus, the couple's capacity to deliver the sympathetic care on which
deep attachments are founded is degraded by their mutual distrust: the
legacy of their elopement is that each suspects the other of being
motivated primarily by lust, greed and ambition.</p>
<p>As Bassanio observes, the gold casket represents &quot;outward shows,&quot; which
&quot;deceiv[e]...with ornament,&quot; in law, religion, war and sexual
relationships (3.2.73-101). Status and physical attraction not only
offer insubstantial rewards, but may easily be manipulated since they
rely on appearances. Launcelot, Lorenzo and Bassanio are all motivated
partly by sexual desire, but first and foremost by a cool determination
to exploit their various relationships for the purposes of
self-advancement. In the terms of the poem contained in the casket, the
gratifications of a &quot;swelling port&quot; are the &quot;gilded tombs,&quot; in order to
&quot;behold&quot; which many lives are &quot;sold&quot; (2.7.65-69). In the later
conversations between Jessica and Lorenzo, Shakespeare shows how
relationships which purport to be intimate may be degraded by the
influence of the gold casket. This influence is evident not only in
Lorenzo's veiled fencing with Jessica, as outlined above, but in his
forced efforts to court her, which founder on the mutual suspicion
engendered by the couple's original crime (5.1.53-70). This suspicion
threatens to hollow out the relationship, reducing it to a gilded
surface, since it impedes the exchange of sympathetic care which is the
life-blood of any deep attachment (2.6.21-24, 3.5.83-90).</p>
<p>Quite apart from conveying Shakespeare's critique of Lorenzo's
superficiality, Salerio and Gratiano's discussion of his tardiness seems
itself to typify the decadence of the Christian community, since both
characters assume that beneath an artificial pretence of fidelity
romantic relationships are primarily driven by a physical &quot;appetite,&quot;
which inevitably &quot;dies in the cradle where it lies&quot; (3.2.67-70):</p>
<p>Who riseth from a feast</p>
<p>With that keen appetite that he sits down?</p>
<p>Where is the horse that doth untread again</p>
<p>His tedious measures with the unbated fire</p>
<p>That he did pace them first? All things that are,</p>
<p>Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.</p>
<p>How like a younger or a prodigal</p>
<p>The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,</p>
<p>Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!</p>
<p>How like the prodigal doth she return,</p>
<p>With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,</p>
<p>Lean, rent, and beggar'd by the strumpet wind. (2.6.8-19)</p>
<p>The repeated references to the parable of the prodigal son in this
speech may remind us of the downgrading of justice which lies at the
heart of Christian doctrine. Portia commits &quot;the husbandry and manage of
[her] house&quot; to the unscrupulous Lorenzo, who is essentially a thief,
while Antonio ensures that the latter profits doubly from his theft
through the provisions which he forces Shylock to make in his will
(3.4.24-26, 4.1.380-90, 5.1.288-95). Similarly, like the father in the
parable, neither Portia nor Antonio explicitly demand that Bassanio, who
is himself twice described as &quot;prodigal&quot; in the course of the play,
should dutifully requite their generosity (1.1.129, 2.5.15). Antonio
encourages Bassanio to borrow from him a second time without feeling any
compunction, even though he has not repaid the original loan, while
Portia ultimately forgives him both for the duplicity of his initial
display of wealth and for the overriding obligation which he has
incurred to his friend in staging this display (1.1.127-60). The
unconditional generosity exhibited by both these characters will no
doubt encourage Lorenzo and Bassanio to continue to expose both
themselves and others to &quot;the strumpet wind[s]&quot; of self-love and
immoderate sensual desire in a manner that is limited only by their
natural sense of justice.</p>
<p>One may infer from these various examples that, paradoxically, the
Christian injunction to &quot;give and hazard all&quot; in a spirit of selfless
love actually may easily emancipate self-loveand immoderate sensual
desire.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup> (This implication is presumably inadvertent on Gratiano's
part, although, as we shall see in the next section, his passionate and
reflective nature, which already in this speech seems to be baulking at
the futility of submitting himself to the vagaries of &quot;the strumpet
wind,&quot; eventually moves him to pursue the more lasting rewards of an
&quot;oblig'd faith&quot; with Nerissa: 2.6.5-7). As Portia's famous speech
indicates, it is ultimately the doctrines of original sin and redemption
which encourage Christians to elide the crucial distinction between what
Jessica refers to as an &quot;upright&quot; life, devoted to a pursuit of the
&quot;joys&quot; of trusting intimacy, and a potentially divisive self-regard
(4.1.184-202, 3.5.73-78; see below for a full analysis of Jessica's
speech). Shakespeare implies that the natural determination to engage in
dutiful, proportionate exchanges of care is often weakened in Christian
communities by the belief that, &quot;in the course of justice, none of us
should see salvation,&quot; since this leads to the toleration of potentially
divisive faults (4.1.199-200).</p>
<p>Thus, Lorenzo behaves in a manner that typifies the Christians in the
play when he refuses even to discuss, let alone attempt to atone for,
the guilt which he feels for having &quot;play[ed] the thie[f].&quot; He
forces Jessica, who wishes to give her &quot;opinion&quot; of him directly (see
below), to join him in communicating only through veiled hints, seeming
banter, classical allusions and small-talk, begging her to let her
reproaches &quot;serve for table-talk; then, howsome'er thou speak'st, 'mong
other things I shall digest it&quot; (3.5.83-90). He attempts to draw a line
under the couple's bitter exchange of classical analogies by declaring
lightly that &quot;in such a night did pretty Jessica (like a little shrow)
slander her love, and he forgave it her,&quot; whereas Jessica herself would
have continued the argument if she had not been interrupted by Portia's
messenger (5.1.20-22; see below). Such a 'forgiveness' is bound to be as
superficial as Launcelot's reunion with his father and Portia's
reconciliation with Bassanio. Ironically, Lorenzo's hope that
tender-heartedness will carry the day in the end is actually shown to
militate against true tenderness, since, just as intimate relationships
demand devoted care, so they necessarily entail a proportionately
rigorous expiation of any failure to fulfil this imperative.</p>
<p>As we have seen, Lorenzo, Bassanio and even Launcelot are nevertheless
partly restrained in the end by a sense of justice which is generated
naturally by their attachments. Even the highly individualistic
Launcelot sues for his father's blessing, having requited him for his
neglect, just as Gobbo himself realises that he must show some concern
for his son in order to re-establish his paternal relationship. However,
just as the relationship between Gobbo and Launcelot cannot easily be
healed, since neither has previously exerted himself to lay the
foundations of a trusting attachment, so, despite their mutual gratitude
and nascent attachment, Lorenzo and Jessica seem fated to continue to
view each other with deep distrust, since each knows that the other's
original motives for engaging in the relationship were primarily
self-regarding. Similarly, Bassanio's initial pursuit of wealth and
status seems likely to thwart his desire to gain fulfilment through a
trusting relationship, since this pursuit has divided him from Portia,
who will no doubt continue to suspect his motives, and bound him instead
to Antonio, whom he deeply admires, but who, for all the reasons given
above, is incapable of sharing a truly intimate friendship.</p>
<p>Overall, Bassanio and Lorenzo, who, unlike Launcelot perhaps, are
capable of forming intimate attachments, are caught between their
self-regard and their natural desire to provide the care which might
establish a relationship based on mutual trust, or in other words,
between the gold and the silver caskets. There is bound to be a
pervasive, enduring tension between these two urges, since both are
powerful, natural motives. At the same time, however, if the above
argument is correct, the conventional injunction to &quot;give and hazard
all&quot; itself tends to generate the conditions in which self-love and
sensual desire may dominate, which means that the decadence of Venice is
attributable as much to the influence of the lead casket as the gold.
Overall, the natural desire of almost all of the Christian characters to
form truly intimate relationships is thwarted in some way or other by
the leaden injunction: whereas it prevents Portia and Antonio from
insisting that their assiduous care is requited, it encourages Lorenzo
and Bassanio to believe that they can establish a deep attachment
without providing such care in the first place.</p>
<h1>The Silver Casket: to &quot;Get as much as [one] Deserves&quot;</h1>
<p>In Jessica and Lorenzo's last conversation Shakespeare uses the images
of music and light to explore the unobtrusive but inexorable influence
exerted by deep attachments. Music is a fitting image for such
attachments, since each performer can only satisfy the instinctive
pleasure which both they and their audience take in &quot;sweet harmony,&quot; or
the &quot;concord of sweet sounds,&quot; by coordinating their performance
carefully (5.1.57, 5.1.84). The music of the spheres--significantly
referred to here as the &quot;harmony...in immortal souls&quot;--to which Lorenzo
directs Jessica's attention before Portia's musicians arrive, provides a
particularly apt image for the pervasive and enduring power of love,
which is implicitly contrasted both with the insubstantial
gratifications of self-love and with a sensual &quot;fancy&quot; that &quot;dies in the
cradle where it lies&quot; (5.1.58-65, 3.2.68-69).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shakespeare also hints at this power in his portrayal of the
&quot;light...burning in [Portia's] hall,&quot; which welcomes her home: &quot;How
far that little candle throws its beams! So shines a good deed in a
naughty world&quot; (5.1.89-91). This remark might remind us that Portia's
mission to protect Antonio--which is both bold and fairly arduous, since
it involves travelling to Venice, mastering some fairly intricate
aspects of Venetian law and planning a forensic strategy--is entirely
inspired by her desire to unite with Bassanio as closely as possible,
which, as we have seen, impels her to observe in minute detail how the
letter that informs him of his friend's predicament &quot;steals the color
from [his] cheek&quot; (3.2.243-50). Like the candle, this sympathy
naturally &quot;throws its beams&quot; beyond Bassanio to &quot;the bosom lover of my
lord&quot; (3.4.10-21). It is significant that Portia fancifully portrays the
break in the moonlight which allows her to see the candle-light so
clearly as caused by &quot;the Moon sleep[ing] with Endymion&quot;: Selene's
request that Zeus put Endymion into a never-ending sleep so that she
could visit him every night provides a fitting image for the calm,
unobtrusive, yet absolutely persistent influence of intimate attachments
(5.1.109-10). (Lorenzo's remark that &quot;the man that hath no music in
himself&quot; must have a spirit which is &quot;dull as night,&quot; and &quot;affections
dark as Erebus&quot; invites the attentive reader to synthesize the two
symbols that dominate this passage: 5.1.83-87).</p>
<p>However, it is also significant both that the candle which Portia and
Nerissa now see, which is clearly a mild light, despite its far-reaching
effects, was previously obscured by moonlight and that the music which
Lorenzo has ordered to be played &quot;sounds much sweeter than by day,&quot; when
even the song of the nightingale would normally be lost amidst the
general din (5.1.92-108). Similarly, Lorenzo tells Jessica that, &quot;whilst
this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear&quot;
the &quot;harmony...in immortal souls&quot; -just as, to draw the images of light
and music together, one cannot see the stars which generate this harmony
by daylight, or hardly, perhaps, even when there is a full moon
(5.1.63-65). I would argue that both these images are used partly to
provide subtle reminders that deep attachments may often be drowned out,
at least for a while, by the vivid, but ephemeral gratifications of
self-love and sensual desire. It is no coincidence that it is during
Portia and Nerissa's conversation that the candle, and presumably
therefore the stars, are most clearly visible, whereas moonlight
dominates the sky both during Jessica and Lorenzo's conversation and
when Bassanio arrives (5.1.1,5.1.54). It is significant also, perhaps,
that Bassanio's first impulse is to offer fulsome praise for Portia's
beauty, which he compares to the radiance of the sun. The latter's
peremptory dismissal of his praise once again serves to associate strong
light with sensual distraction: &quot;Let me give light, but let me not be
light, for a light wife doth make a heavy husband&quot; (5.1.1, 5.1.54,
5.1.124-30).</p>
<p>Shakespeare uses Jessica to show both the influence that such
distractions may exert and the unobtrusive, yet persistent
counter-influence of deep attachments. Far from being a sign that
Jessica is completely unmusical, and therefore only &quot;fit for treasons,
stratagems, and spoils,&quot; as Lorenzo darkly suspects, the fact that she
is &quot;never merry when [she] hear[s] sweet music&quot; is precisely an
indication of a passionate nature, albeit one that has been thrown into
disharmony (5.1.83-88, 5.1.69). As we have seen, the intense guilt which
Jessica feels for betraying her father implies that she is far more
deeply attached to him than she has previously acknowledged (see the
analysis of 5.1.12-14 above). Her superficial preference for the status
and stimulus afforded by the Christian community over the &quot;tediousness
of Shylock's staid &quot;manners&quot; and &quot;sober house&quot; is perfectly compatible
with an underlying, unacknowledged attachment to her father (2.3.18-21,
2.3.3, 2.5.36). It is this attachment which doubtless moves her to &quot;make
fast the doors,&quot; just as her father repeatedly requested, even as she is
&quot;steal[ing] from&quot; him in both senses of that phrase (2.6.49-50,
2.5.28-36, 2.5.53-55).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jessica has taken her father's care for granted, just as one might
ambient music. She dismisses the security which her home life has
offered as &quot;tedious...&quot;--it is significant that she can offer no
stronger criticism--only because she is constantly contrasting it to the
more sensual and liberal culture by which she is surrounded (2.3.3). The
drums, pipes and bright torches of the Christian revellers represent
precisely the sort of strident and vivid stimulants which tend at times
to overwhelm the unobtrusive harmony and light which flow from close
attachments (2.5.29-30, 2.4.5., 2.6.40-44). Only now, after Jessica has
exhausted her appetite for such stimulants, can she appreciate how much
she has previously relied upon the &quot;sober&quot; domestic life which Shylock
oversaw, just as Portia and Nerissa can only focus on the candle-light
and the music in the &quot;soft stillness&quot; of a moonless night (3.1.108-12,
3.1.118-19, 5.1.56-57, 5.1.92-101).</p>
<p>In her long eulogy of Portia Jessica reveals a heartfelt understanding
of the &quot;joys&quot; which can be derived from relationships that are based on
an equitable balance of &quot;merit&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is very meet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,</p>
<p>For having such a blessing in his lady,</p>
<p>He finds the joys of heaven here on earth,</p>
<p>And if on earth he do not merit it,</p>
<p>In reason he should never come to heaven!</p>
<p>Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,</p>
<p>And on the wager lay two earthly women,</p>
<p>And Portia one, there must be something else</p>
<p>Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world</p>
<p>Hath not her fellow. (3.5.73-83)</p>
<p>Ironically, Jessica is actually far more aware than the friend whom she
admires so much that the desire to gain &quot;the joys of heaven here on
earth&quot; imposes stern demands, since deep attachments are founded on
diligent care, which can only be delivered by lovers who are equally
determined to lead &quot;an upright life.&quot; Her idea that something would have
to be &quot;pawn'd&quot; to balance Portia's virtues hints at the need not only to
lead such a life oneself, but to gauge the &quot;merit&quot; of prospective
partners. Since these &quot;joys&quot; may only be earned through an equitably
reciprocated care, they are implicitly associated with the silver
casket. This speech contains the clearest formulation in the play both
of the ultimate good of a trusting relationship and of the arduous means
whereby it may be achieved.</p>
<p>Unlike the doctrine represented by the lead casket, which, as we have
seen, is primarily conventional, and the drives represented by the gold,
which are entirely natural--although, as we have seen, frequently
facilitated by Christian doctrine--the silver casket principle is not
only rooted deeply in nature, but may in some cultures be strongly
reinforced by habitual opinions. Jessica's innate sense that &quot;the joys
of heaven here on earth&quot; are only available to those who can earn them
by &quot;liv[ing] an upright life&quot; is supported by Jewish doctrine, which
clearly continues to influence her, despite her expedient conversion to
Christianity. She has learnt that those who live a just life will be
doubly rewarded, since, in addition to experiencing these earthly
&quot;joys,&quot; they will also literally &quot;come to heaven&quot; in the end, while, by
implication, the unjust will be punished by divine sanctions as well as
by their inability to form truly intimate relationships (3.5.78). Unlike
the injunction to &quot;give and hazard all,&quot; the Jewish emphasis on duty and
justice reflects the way in which close attachments actually operate,
since, as we have seen, they naturally rely on a proportionate
interchange of care. By the same token, the commandment to honour one's
parents for their care doubtless reinforces the remorse which Jessica
instinctively feels for her filial ingratitude.</p>
<p>The running contrasts between Jessica and the Christians point to the
role which conventional principles may play in supporting or,
conversely, degrading the restraints which attachments naturally demand.
Unlike Portia, who, as we have seen, does not hesitate to circumvent her
father's love test, Jessica remains seriously convinced that filial
disobedience is a &quot;heinous sin,&quot; even as she is &quot;steal[ing] from&quot;
Shylock (2.3.16-17). In direct contrast with Portia again, who actively
relishes the prospect of dressing as a &quot;bragging youth,&quot; Jessica, who
has clearly been taught to conduct herself in a modest and restrained
manner at all times, is deeply &quot;asham'd&quot; to expose herself in men's
clothing, presumably because it is relatively revealing (2.6.34-44;
3.4.60-78).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup> Although Jessica's initial betrayal of Shylock of
course shows the inevitable limitations of such a
habituation--especially in a situation where it may constantly be
contrasted with a much more liberal culture--her subsequent remorse
points to the enduring power of her training to reinforce the impulses
which naturally moderate self-love.</p>
<p>It is significant that it is Jessica who wishes to discuss the problems
in her marriage, whereas, although Lorenzo expresses a wish to be as
&quot;upright&quot; a husband as Portia is a wife, it is he who strives to divert
her from pointing out the faults which have prevented him from earning
her trust (3.5.83-90). By contrast with Antonio, who ensures that
Lorenzo is ultimately rewarded doubly for the theft which he helped to
perpetrate, Jessica wishes to rebuke her husband as harshly as she
rebukes herself. It is characteristic of Jessica not only to face her
own guilt squarely, as is implied by her comparison of herself to Medea
(see above), but to attempt to force Lorenzo to do the same: whereas
Lorenzo attempts to draw a line under the increasingly bitter
recriminations which the couple exchange in their final conversation by
offering a superficial forgiveness, Jessica would have &quot;out-night[ed]&quot;
him had she not been interrupted by the messenger (5.1.12-24). Whereas
Jessica strives to precipitate the just exchange of recriminations and
mutual acceptance of blame which might have cleared the way for a
reciprocal forgiveness, Lorenzo consistently thwarts these efforts.</p>
<p>I would argue that the parallel between Jessica's opening remarks and
those of Portia and Antonio actually hints at the contrasts between
Judaic and Christian culture: Jessica laments the tedium of her life in
her opening lines, but never feels the &quot;weary&quot; ennui from which both the
Christian characters suffer, even when she is deeply troubled later on
in the play (compare 1.1.1-2, 1.2.1-2 with 2.3.1-3). Whereas the lead
casket injunction prevents Portia and Antonio from pursuing fulfilment
through a fully reciprocated love, the very bitterness of Jessica's
regret is itself a sign that she is by now sharply aware of &quot;the joys of
heaven here on earth&quot; which she has forfeited (3.5.76). Her implicit
comparison of her state of mind to that of Medea as she strove to &quot;renew
old Aeson&quot; suggests that her guilt is not simply self-lacerating, but
may eventually drive her to embark on some sort of atonement, which,
although arduous, would be an act of love. If the above interpretation
of Shakespeare's symbolism is correct, it is significant that Jessica is
invariably moved deeply, even during the day-time, by the very music
which Portia usually ignores (5.1.69, 5.1.99-100). The contrasts between
Jessica and the Christians imply that her keen awareness of the
aforementioned &quot;joys&quot; is facilitated by her previous habituation to a
faith which prioritises &quot;get[ting] as much [one] deserves.&quot;</p>
<p>It is generally Shylock who embodies the silver casket principle most
fully in the play. I would argue that Shylock's initial aim is simply to
requite Antonio proportionately for his persistent insults and his
generous loans, which bring down the rate of interest. His employment of
a colloquial wrestling image to express his righteous indignation--he
has a desire to &quot;catch him once upon the hip&quot; in order to &quot;feed fat the
ancient grudge&quot;--should certainly not be taken to suggest that his
intentions are murderous from the start (1.3.46-47). His early gambits
in act 1 scene 4 seem designed merely to humiliate Antonio in fairly
trivial ways in return for reviling him and his &quot;bargains,
and...well-won thrift&quot; (1.3.48-51). He uses the pretext that Antonio's
&quot;means are in supposition&quot; to demand that the merchant ask for the loan
in person--and in public, rather than at Bassanio's putative
dinner--making it clear that he is now the one in control of proceedings
by then casually changing the subject: &quot;What news on the Rialto?&quot;
(1.3.1-39). He initially affects to ignore Antonio when the latter
eventually appears, presumably in the hope that he will feel impelled to
adopt the role of a &quot;fawning publican&quot; in his anxiety to secure the
loan, and when he refuses to do so, subjects him instead to a long
speech in defence of shrewd profit-making, knowing that for the first
time the haughty merchant will be forced to listen to him with at least
a degree of civility (1.3.41-90).</p>
<p>Shylock appears to be about to offer Antonio a loan at his normal rate
of interest when he suddenly breaks off, apparently angered by the
merchant's persistent refusal to moderate his attacks, even in a
situation where he might be expected to play the &quot;fawning&quot; supplicant
(1.3.97-110). What follows amounts to an exasperated appeal, albeit one
which is disguised in characteristic fashion by a self-protective, gruff
sardonicism: can Antonio really expect a man whom he is continuing to
treat as &quot;a dog&quot; or &quot;a cur&quot; to lend him money in his need (1.3.111-29)?
Surely the sense of common justice which naturally governs human
relationships would dictate that he should at least treat his putative
creditor politely, even if he does not actively express gratitude
(1.3.111-29)? Shylock's appeal might remind us that Antonio is far from
respecting this natural standard. Ironically, it is actually the
generous Antonio who brusquely suggests that Shylock should add a
punitive element to the contract, while it is his apparently purely
acquisitive interlocutor who attempts to humanise the situation. As we
have seen, rather than following Shylock's hint that he might now have
the grace to soften his proud contempt for usury, Antonio protects his
sense of moral superiority by proposing that the Jew should think of
himself as dealing with an &quot;enemy,&quot; so that he can &quot;with better face
exact the penalty,&quot; if the chance should arise (1.3.130-37).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup> This
contrast perhaps suggests that, whereas Antonio's altruism is
inconsistent because it is ultimately driven by pride, the silver casket
injunction is rooted in the imperatives which naturally govern
attachment -which, as we shall see, is by no means to deny that it may
be reinforced by pride.</p>
<p>We may further infer from the fact that it is Antonio who introduces the
idea of a harsh penalty that the pound of flesh forfeit is not deeply
premeditated on Shylock's part. It is also worth bearing in mind that at
this point the most likely outcome of the bond is that enough of the
merchant's ships will return to enable him to redeem the loan: later in
the play Shylock is surprised by the merchant's &quot;ill luck,&quot; while at the
same time determining to exploit it opportunistically (3.1.97-107).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">[42]</a></sup>
All of this is not to argue that the original bond is simply &quot;a merry
sport,&quot; as Shylock maintains: if fate should grant him the opportunity,
he undoubtedly plans to requite Antonio proportionately for his &quot;hard
dealings&quot; by threatening to impose the forfeit for a while in a manner
that is calculated to terrify him (1.3.145, 1.3.161).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is even possible to take seriously Shylock's claim that he is
ultimately endeavouring to &quot;buy [Antonio's] favor,&quot; and
&quot;extend...friendship&quot; by offering an interest-free loan, so that they
can &quot;be friends,&quot; and forget their feud (1.3.168, 1.3.138-42).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">[44]</a></sup> He
is perhaps dimly hoping that, in the unlikely event that Antonio's
ventures should all fail, he and his circle of friends might feel
intense gratitude when he suddenly reveals, no doubt after a spiteful
delay, that he has in reality no intention of imposing the forfeit.
Despite his show of belligerence (see below), his eventual, pained
decision to accept Bassanio's invitation to dinner, having refused
initially to eat at a house where he might &quot;smell pork,&quot; is in reality
probably a sign that he is prepared to extend himself in order to ease
relations with the Christian community (2.5.11-16; compare 1.3.32-38;
see below). All of this is by no means to deny that Shylock is
sufficiently proud of his cultural identity to relish his chance to turn
the tables on Antonio by showing him that a Jew is capable of being
&quot;kind&quot; and open-hearted, and that it is in fact the Christians who are
narrow-minded and suspicious (1.3.142, 1.3.160-62).</p>
<p>If the above analysis is correct, Shylock's prioritisation of justice
leaves room for a guarded generosity, which seems designed to
&quot;buy...favor&quot; by &quot;extend[ing]...friendship,&quot; or in other words, to
initiate the equitable interchange of care and gratitude that naturally
sustains harmonious relationships (1.3.168). Ironically, the offer he
makes to Antonio would thus in some ways parallel the merchant's own
offer to Bassanio (the parallel is underlined by the fact that Shylock
too is forced to borrow the capital for the loan -1.3.55-58).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">[45]</a></sup> Both
men may be proceeding on the assumption that generosity begets
gratitude, but, unlike Antonio, whose relationships, both with his
friends and his enemies, are stunted by the pride which he takes in his
own apparent adherence to a code of pure altruism, Shylock evaluates
what he and others might &quot;deserve&quot; in a measured way--at least until
Jessica's elopement deprives him of his normal self-control--requiting
the &quot;hard dealings&quot; of his enemies proportionately, while at the same
time still giving himself the scope to make magnanimous advances, in
however guarded a manner.</p>
<p>Shylock frequently disguises his feelings by employing &quot;the raw, rueful
irony of the outsider.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">[46]</a></sup> He goads the Christians throughout the
play, in a restrained manner at first, as when he plays on the word
&quot;good&quot; to describe Antonio, or frustrates him with his exhaustive
account of Jacob's &quot;woolly breeders,&quot; and grimly later, as when he
casually and provocatively compares his antipathy to the merchant to a
phobia of &quot;gaping pig[s],&quot; cats and bagpipes (1.3.12-17, 1.3.71-90,
4.1.47-50). The audience may well be as provoked as the court by this
casual account of his motives, forgetting that he introduces it by
declaring that &quot;[he]'ll not answer&quot; those who ask why he is pursuing
an apparently profitless suit so remorselessly, but rather will simply
say that it is his &quot;humor&quot;, and concludes it by affirming that he &quot;will
not&quot; give any further &quot;reason&quot; (4.1.40-65).</p>
<p>Indeed, Shylock's habitual principles seem to encourage him to display
what one might call a sort of reverse hypocrisy throughout the play: by
contrast with the Christian characters, who foreground their generosity
while disguising or partially repressing their self-regard, Shylock
tends, at least in the first half of the play, to speak more harshly
than he acts. He manages to retain a sense of power in his beleaguered
situation by consistently adopting what one might term a somewhat
misleading rhetoric of retribution: his response to Launcelot's
resignation, which we actually know to have been entirely the latter's
decision--a decision which in reality illustrates the pervasive
prejudice to which the Jew is subjected--is to declare, disingenuously,
&quot;Drones hive not with me, therefore I part with him&quot; (2.2.1-32,
2.5.48-49). Similarly, he manages to find a way of welcoming Launcelot's
resignation and immediate reemployment by fantasising that his dissolute
servant will &quot;help to waste [Bassanio's] borrowed purse&quot; (2.5.50-51).
His comment that he will &quot;go in hate&quot; to Bassanio's supper, purely &quot;to
feed upon the prodigal Christian,&quot; seems equally fanciful
(2.5.14-15).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">[47]</a></sup> He would surely not force himself to leave his house
in the face of all his worries, when he has &quot;no mind of feasting forth
to-night,&quot; unless he were still hoping against hope that the invitation
might offer him a chance to resolve his conflicts with the Christians
(2.5.16-18, 2.5.36-39).</p>
<p>If the above analysis is correct, the pound of flesh contract itself, at
least as it was originally conceived, may be seen merely as another of
the power fantasies by which Shylock habitually relieves his feelings. I
would argue that the same applies to his early remarks to Chus and
Tubal, as reported by Jessica, to the effect that he &quot;would rather have
Antonio's flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he did owe
him&quot; (3.2.284-290). Shylock's often misleading stance of uncompromising
self-assertion is exploited by Shakespeare to disguise his deeper
themes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">[48]</a></sup> Thus, readers and audiences are invited to take the pound
of flesh contract seriously from the start, and to join the Christian
characters in recoiling from the harsh rhetoric which the Jew employs
throughout the play.</p>
<p>Shylock's justice is manifested most clearly in his approach to profit.
In rejecting the silver casket, Bassanio describes money--with a glib
affectation of lordly indifference--as a &quot;pale and common drudge 'tween
man and man&quot; (3.2.103-04). (Perhaps Shakespeare hints at the
disingenuousness of Bassanio's critique of the economic motive by
ensuring that it is drowned out by the song which Portia requests:
3.2.63-107.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">[49]</a></sup>) Money is indeed integral to the silver casket because
it clearly provides a key means of providing an individual with &quot;as much
as he deserves&quot; (2.7.7). Shylock explicitly sets a high value on
material wealth: his robust, unashamed sense of self-preservation, which
contrasts directly with Antonio's apparent indifference to the fate of
his ships and willingness to sacrifice his own life for Bassanio, is
evident in his declaration that &quot;life&quot; is dependent on &quot;the means
whereby [one] live[s]&quot; (4.1.374-77). As we have seen, he certainly
resents Antonio partly because the merchant endangers his profits by
&quot;bring[ing] down the rate of usance&quot; (1.3.42-51; see also 3.1.48-50).
Moreover, he &quot;dream[s] of money bags&quot; in times of stress (2.5.18). He
is, furthermore, undoubtedly horrified by the loss of his gold and his
&quot;precious, precious jewels,&quot; as well as by Jessica's disloyalty
(3.1.86-87, 3.1.110-12).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Shylock's &quot;bargains and...well-won thrift&quot; are
distinguished from Bassanio's unscrupulous adventuring as sharply as
they are from Antonio's apparently disinterested altruism. The
&quot;gain[ing]&quot; of money in return for &quot;giv[ing]&quot; one's time or effort,
which in Shylock's case involves driving shrewd &quot;bargains&quot;--which are
nevertheless not without some risk, as is evident in the case of
Antonio--combines the leaden and golden principles in a manner that
resolves their respective deficiencies. His faith reinforces the natural
sense of justice which governs his transactions: drawing on a story from
the Bible which illustrates Jacob's prudence, he declares that &quot;thrift
is blessing, if men steal it not&quot; (1.3.71-90). It should be noted that
Jacob was a working &quot;shepherd,&quot; albeit a particularly &quot;skillful&quot; one
(1.3.84). Shylock has no problem with being compensated adequately for
his own &quot;skill...,&quot; which has no doubt been laboriously acquired,
whereas for Antonio the whole concept of earning a living is
problematic, especially as his profession seems even further removed
than most from the sort of generous service which might accord with his
Christian principles.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, Shylock's economic transactions are not his primary
concern. Ironically, given its proverbial connotations, the pound of
flesh contract is in fact notably unmaterialistic: he will &quot;take no doit
of usance for [his] moneys,&quot; for, as he himself points out, &quot;a pound
of man's flesh...is not so estimable, profitable neither, as flesh of
muttons, beefs, or goats&quot; (1.3.140-41, 1.3.162-67). Moreover, even the
hostile Christian observers present Shylock as mentioning the loss of
his daughter before that of his ducats, and as longing to punish Jessica
firstly for having &quot;fled,&quot; and only secondly for the theft which she has
perpetrated (2.8.12-22). When we actually hear him speak about the
elopement, he does not even mention his material losses for eighty
lines, and when he does it is to wish that his &quot;daughter were dead at
[his] foot, and the jewels in her ear!&quot; and again that she &quot;were
hears'd at [his] foot, and the ducats in her coffin!&quot; -curses which
imply that he would gladly discard everything Jessica stole for a chance
to punish her for her disloyalty (3.1.87-90). He is &quot;torture[d]&quot; most
acutely by the news that she has sold a ring that was given to him by
his deceased wife, Leah, to whose memory he clearly remains devoted; a
ring which he himself &quot;would not have given...for a wilderness of
monkeys&quot; (3.1.118-23).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">[50]</a></sup> As Maus puts it, &quot;Shylock pretends that he
thinks of people in purely materialistic, economic terms; but he becomes
a moving character at precisely those moments when he admits another
kind of value.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, Shylock generally approaches this other &quot;kind of value&quot; in the
same way as he approaches his professional transactions. Both in
financial and emotional matters Shylock pays his way and presumes that
he will realise a profit in return. His reckless rage at Jessica's
elopement, which in the courtroom scene leads him initially to turn down
&quot;thrice&quot; the original loan, implies that the currency that has really
mattered to him is the mutual gratitude and care which he assumed would
bind him to his daughter forever (4.1.227-30; see also 4.1.318-19).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">[52]</a></sup>
Shylock's attitude to &quot;well-won thrift&quot; thus provides no more than the
most concrete illustration of his broader conviction that &quot;giv[ing]&quot;
and &quot;gain[ing]&quot; should always be commensurate.</p>
<p>Shylock only behaves unjustly when he has been driven beyond endurance
by his daughter's disloyalty. Indeed, a close analysis of the events
surrounding the elopement might even go some way towards justifying his
decision to seize his only opportunity to exact retribution not only on
Antonio, but on the circle of Christians who have abetted the elopement,
most of whom, as he no doubt appreciates, will be tormented with anger
and anxiety as they watch the court proceedings (see, for instance,
4.1.63-68, 4.1.121-42, 4.1.209-17, 4.1.282-92).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">[53]</a></sup> His determination
to take his pound of flesh is by no means as arbitrary as he himself
misleadingly asserts (4.1.43-62). He is right to declare to Salerio,
&quot;You knew, none so well as you, of my daughter's flight,&quot; for the latter
was certainly one of Lorenzo's accomplices, as indeed was Gratiano
(3.1.24-27, 2.4.28-39, 2.6.1-59). Not only did Gratiano and Salerio help
Lorenzo to execute the plan, but it is likely that Bassanio also
&quot;conspired&quot; to facilitate the elopement by inviting Shylock to dinner,
as Launcelot inadvertently implies--a dinner which also seems to have
been designed to enable Jessica to contact Lorenzo via Launcelot--while
Launcelot himself not only acts as Jessica's messenger, but does what he
can on his own account to persuade Shylock to attend (2.5.11-13,
2.5.19-22, 2.3.4-9, 2.4.10-20). Ironically, it seems at first that
Antonio is almost the only one of the Christians who is not involved in
this plot, since he clearly has no idea why Gratiano is late to board
the ship which is to take Bassanio to Belmont (2.6.62-66). However, it
is the merchant who ensures that &quot;the Duke [is] given to understand&quot;
that the couple escaped on a gondola by confirming that they were not on
board Bassanio's ship (2.8.6-11). Salerio's ambiguous phrase casts doubt
on the veracity of this romantic account. Clearly, Shylock is
disproportionately vindictive, as he himself seems to acknowledge, but
even at this point his actions are still loosely informed by a code of
justice (4.1.206).</p>
<p>Shylock is certainly a strict father, but I would argue that his rule is
affectionate rather than tyrannical. Given his worries about the masque,
it is significant that he trusts his daughter, whom he addresses as &quot;my
girl,&quot; to &quot;look to [his] house&quot; and &quot;lock up [his] doors,&quot; rather
than doing so himself (2.5.15-16, 2.5.28-29, 2.5.53-55). His main
concern, which, as we have seen, the play tends to endorse, seems to be
to protect Jessica from the self-love and immoderate sensuality of
&quot;Christian fools with varnish'd faces&quot; (2.5.28-36). Clearly, the most
effective means of doing so would be to transmit to her his own code of
duty and self-restraint. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shylock's anguished reaction to Jessica's elopement provides a measure
of the true depth of the bond between father and daughter. At first,
when addressing interlocutors whom he knows to be unsympathetic, he
merely hints at the intense pain of his loss through generalised
rhetorical questions: &quot;If you prick us, do we not bleed...If you poison
us, do we not die?&quot; (3.1.64-66). However, he later reveals the full
extent of his grief to the trusted Tubal: there are &quot;no sighs but a' my
breathing, no tears but a' my shedding&quot; (3.1.95-96). It is not until
this point in the play that Shylock asserts, &quot;And if you wrong us, shall
we not revenge?&quot; and declares that he is &quot;very glad&quot; to hear of
Antonio's unexpected financial misfortunes, since he is now able to
&quot;plague&quot; and &quot;torture him&quot; (3.1.66-67, 3.1.113-17). Although Shakespeare
leaves these matters deliberately ambiguous--for reasons explored
below--many critics have felt that this is the moment when Shylock first
determines to cause Antonio serious harm.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">[55]</a></sup> This is apparently also
Solanio's view, since he chooses this moment to declare that the
merchant must &quot;look he keep his day, or he shall pay for this&quot;
(3.1.25-26).</p>
<p>Shylock's enduring anger is a measure of his care for Jessica. Although
he later refuses to explain his motive for wishing to take the pound of
flesh to a Christian court, choosing instead to provoke his audience in
characteristically insouciant fashion by comparing his situation to that
of a man who is &quot;troubled with a rat,&quot; or &quot;a gaping pig,&quot; an unobtrusive
aside confirms that he is still tormented by Jessica's elopement: &quot;I
have a daughter--would any of the stock of Barrabas had been her husband
rather than a Christian!&quot; (4.1.294-97). This comment exposes his ongoing
care for Jessica as well as his grief: he fears for her future, having
inferred--quite justifiably--from Bassanio and Gratiano's willingness to
sacrifice their wives for Antonio that Christian husbands do not
consider the marital bond to be absolutely binding. One should thus not
take literally the outpourings by which he seeks to relieve his pain
after Jessica's elopement -as we have seen, he expresses a wish that she
&quot;were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!&quot; (3.1.87-90). As one
critic notes, &quot;Tubal is sent to search for Jessica, not to poison her&quot;
(3.1.79-82, 3.1.90-93; see below).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shylock's care for Jessica and his indignation at her ingratitude are
both reinforced by his devout faith. He swears &quot;by Jacob's staff&quot; and
&quot;father Abram,&quot; and clearly has a literal belief in the Bible (2.5.36,
1.3.160, 1.3.77-90). Shylock's God is stern and retributive. He declares
that Jessica &quot;is damn'd&quot; for rebelling (2.5.28-36, 3.1.31). Far from
habitually restraining his anger in the Christian manner, he has been
encouraged by his faith to &quot;feed fat the ancient grudge&quot; when he has
suffered egregious wrongs (1.3.47). This does not mean of course that
this faith encourages him to punish Antonio with such disproportionate
harshness. Although in response to the Duke's demand to know how he will
&quot;hope for mercy, rend'ring none,&quot; he replies, &quot;What judgment shall I
dread, doing no wrong?&quot; this insouciant assertion, although it serves to
make the serious point that his own God is just rather than merciful, is
soon revealed to be provocative rather than sincere: when Portia invites
him to relent, he simply answers, &quot;My deeds upon my head!&quot; (4.1.88-89,
4.1.184-206). He assumes that he will be punished by God for his
immoderate vindictiveness.</p>
<p>Shylock was as careful of Jessica as of his &quot;own flesh and blood,&quot; and
was encouraged both by natural love and by habitual belief to expect
this concern to be requited (3.1.34-38). Paradoxically, far from
stifling passion, the rigidly hierarchical and patriarchal social
structure which the Jewish faith helps to sustain is generally shown to
reinforce the equitable exchanges of care which nurture deep-rooted
attachments: Shylock's heart-felt shock at Jessica's ingratitude is
compounded by his thwarted expectation that she would conform to the
pious principles of shame and duty which he has sought to instil in her.
As the song which Portia has her musicians sing to Bassanio implies,
deep attachments, as compared to those which are &quot;fancy bred,&quot; are
&quot;begot&quot; and &quot;nourished&quot; in &quot;the head&quot; as well as &quot;the heart,&quot; since all
those who love truly are naturally concerned both to deliver care and to
gauge the extent to which it is returned, whether they acknowledge this
or not (3.2.62-70). The Jewish faith seeks to enforce the moderation of
self-love and sensual desire which this process entails, so that
individual lovers are not forced constantly to reinvent the wheel of
devoted care and dutiful gratitude, as they may be in contemporary
liberal cultures.</p>
<p>Although this emphasis might seem to a liberal audience to invite a
cooler approach to relationships than the seemingly unconditional
&quot;giv[ing] and hazard[ing]&quot; of Portia and Antonio, Shakespeare
covertly suggests that the reverse is in fact the case. Whereas
Shylock's faith reinforces his natural conception of love as a binding
web of reciprocal duties, the enshrinement of freely given love as a
guiding principle ironically proves to foster a potentially divisive
individualism, since, as we have seen, it actively encourages Christians
to strive to repress their concern to secure a return for their care,
and, by the same token, liberates their beloveds to exploit that care.</p>
<p>It is significant that Solanio makes light of Shylock's horror at his
own &quot;flesh and blood...rebel[ling],&quot; affecting to believe that this
phrase refers merely to the weakening of his own capacities (3.1.34-38).
Shakespeare shows throughout the play that it is alien to Christian
thinking to conceive of attachments as bonds which impose obligations.
As his quibble on the phrase &quot;flesh and blood&quot; implies, Solanio's
assumptions are individualistic and self-regarding: he considers, for
instance, that &quot;once the bird was flidge...it is the complexion of them
all to leave the dam&quot; (3.1.28-30). Ultimately, as I have argued, it is
this culture of individualism which encourages the coolness that
pertains between Launcelot and his father: neither feel that they have
an enduring duty to care for the other. Shylock's view of Christian
culture as inherently conducive to inconstancy is in fact generally
borne out by the play: whereas he himself seems to have remained
faithful even to the bare memory of Leah, we have seen that the
marriages of Bassanio and Lorenzo are built on shaky, materialistic
foundations (3.1.120-23). Whereas Shylock values Leah's ring forever as
a symbol of his love, Bassanio gives up Portia's ring because his wish
to show a &quot;swelling port&quot; has left him beholden to the seemingly
infinite generosity of Antonio.</p>
<p>To repeat, the overall suggestion therefore seems to be that, just as
deep attachments tend to flourish in cultures where love is seen as
entailing a binding web of duties, so they may be sapped by Christian
and post-Christian liberalism. Paradoxically, a rigidly hierarchical and
patriarchal society may support deep attachments more effectively than a
liberal one which defines love as unconditional generosity rather than
as an exchange of care. (It is worth reemphasising at this point that
Jessica's resentment at the &quot;tediousness&quot; of her upbringing is
exacerbated by the fact that, rather than being brought up within a
uniformly conservative culture, she has always been surrounded by the
temptations of a more liberal one: in a homogenous Jewish community, she
might have prioritised her filial affection from the start.)</p>
<p>All of this is not to imply that the Christians lack a dutiful and
grateful desire to care for their beloveds, or a sense of guilt and
righteous indignation when that desire is thwarted. This would be
impossible if, as Shakespeare implies, justice naturally plays an
integral role in attachments, even if its influence is at times obscured
both by self-love and by conventional doctrine. As we have seen,
Bassanio feels deeply guilty when Antonio's life is threatened because
of the loan, while, in reality, the merchant longs for his friend to be
bound to him precisely in this way. Likewise, Lorenzo is moved by
gratitude to attempt to form a genuine intimacy with Jessica, while even
Launcelot eventually accepts his father's blessing, after he has
punished him, however inadequately, for his neglect. Moreover, the
Christians' harsh punishment of Shylock--who was after all doing nothing
that anyone in the courtroom initially considered to be
unlawful--suggests that the latter is right to suspect that their
conventional stance of merciful &quot;humility&quot; is bound to falter when their
natural indignation is roused: &quot;If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his
humility? Revenge&quot; (3.1.67-69). Indeed, as we have seen, this stance is
itself unconsciously rooted in a conception of justice. Although, if the
above argument is correct, the Christian emphasis on &quot;giv[ing] and
hazard[ing] all&quot; may often distort attachments and promote
individualism, Shakespeare shows that the desire to form harmonious
attachments, along with the guilt and righteous indignation which are
its natural corollaries, exerts an unobtrusive, yet ineluctable
gravitational pull on all the characters in the play, including the
Christians themselves, impelling even the most self-regarding of them to
respect basic principles of justice. Particular beliefs may distort and
stunt this desire, just as they may facilitate its fulfilment, but they
can never entirely eradicate it, any more than the &quot;muddy vesture of
decay&quot; can eradicate the music of the spheres (5.1.64).</p>
<p>There is nothing of the lead casket about the passionate Gratiano and
little of the gold, at least after he has sworn to devote himself to
Nerissa. Gratitude is his key note, as his name suggests. His affection
for Antonio and consequent sense of obligation to the lawyers who save
his life are so intense that he gives the ring which he promised Nerissa
&quot;to keep for ever&quot; to Balthazar's clerk, as he thinks, even though he
must know that his new wife might see this act as a gross betrayal of
trust: &quot;I could not for my heart deny it him&quot; (4.2.13-14, 5.1.142-65).
Unlike Bassanio, who owes his new found status to Antonio, Gratiano
risks his future happiness at this point purely because he feels so
indebted to the saviour of a friend whom he loves (4.1.282-92).</p>
<p>Gratiano's capacity to feel intense gratitude to others is matched by
his determination to &quot;get as much as he deserves&quot; for himself. The
&quot;love&quot; that moves him to criticise Antonio at the start of the play is
simultaneously generous and self-interested in an entirely natural way:
seeing that the merchant is &quot;marvellously chang'd&quot; by &quot;care,&quot; so that he
&quot;look[s] not well,&quot; he exerts himself to regain a friend with whom he
wishes to share &quot;mirth and laughter&quot; (1.1.73-76). The passionate
&quot;exhortation&quot; which he delivers to Antonio at this point underlines his
conviction that the gratifications of self-love are insubstantial
compared to the real pleasures of friendship (1.1.79-104). Gratiano
seems to be as unaffected by Christian doctrine as he is by self-love,
since his ultimate goal is to &quot;get as much&quot; of these pleasures as he can
show his friends that he &quot;deserves.&quot;</p>
<p>Unlike Lorenzo and Bassanio, Gratiano feels passionately drawn to court
his wife-to-be, who is of course relatively poor and undistinguished
(2.2.178-79; compare 2.6.1-24). Unlike Antonio and Bassanio, he
disguises his true nature purely in order to pursue this attachment,
rather than to gain &quot;opinion&quot; or social status and wealth (2.2.180-97).
He eschews both the gold and the lead casket by giving and gaining in
equal measure. Unlike Bassanio on the one hand, who is never shown
actively courting Portia, and who boasts of his achievement when he has
won her before vowing to be faithful, and Antonio on the other, who
denies altogether that his sacrifices are designed to secure his
friend's affection, Gratiano has wooed Nerissa assiduously,
&quot;sweat[ing]&quot; repeatedly, and &quot;swearing till [his] very roof was dry
with oaths of love,&quot; because for him the emotional stakes are so high
(compare 3.2.175-85 and 3.2.203-07).</p>
<p>Gratiano's sexual desire for Nerissa has clearly reinforced an
attachment which he is now bent on deepening through faithful, diligent
care. After urging his wife to come to bed quickly, he concludes the
play with a heartfelt vow, which is strengthened rather than undermined
by its bawdy undertones: &quot;Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing so
sore, as keeping safe Nerissa's ring&quot; (5.1.300-07). Gratiano's frank
request underlines the fact that he is too passionate to &quot;give and
hazard all he hath&quot; without demanding his due rewards. Certainly, these
rewards are partly sexual, but, unlike Launcelot, he does not separate
physical desire from his urge to start a family, with all the care and
dutiful restraint which the fulfilment of this desire will inevitably
entail (3.2.213-17). Shakespeare implies that this moderate approach to
sexual desire is ultimately more satisfying than Launcelot's
promiscuity, which threatens to leave him permanently isolated.</p>
<p>Nerissa too is loyal and self-controlled: she refuses to leave her
mistress until she knows that Portia is to marry Bassanio (3.2.206-09).
As we have seen, she informs Portia forthrightly that she must control
some of her passions in order to &quot;rightly love&quot; (1.2.3-11). She puts her
own advice into practice, since she strives patiently to promote a fully
trusting intimacy with those whom she loves: by contrast with Portia's
approach to Bassanio, Nerissa has clearly insisted that her lover should
court her diligently in order to prove his loyalty (3.2.203-07).
Overall, Gratiano and Nerissa are used to show that Christians who are
sufficiently passionate to form deep attachments will naturally be
regulated by the silver casket rather than the lead or the gold, since
they will strive to earn a trusting intimacy by exercising disciplined
care. It is no coincidence that theirs is the only relationship in the
play which bids fair to be thoroughly fulfilling.</p>
<p>The one substantial difference between the values of Shylock and
Gratiano becomes apparent when, to Shylock's scorn, Gratiano vows that
he would exchange his wife's life for Antonio's (4.1.290-95). Whereas
for Shylock, the formal ceremony of marriage and all the domestic duties
which it entails automatically override all other relationships, the
Christian or liberal approach allows non-domestic intimacies to flow
more freely at times, even as it tends to dilute them for all the
reasons described above, since it prioritises attachments purely on the
grounds of natural affection. Thus, friendship is the one area in which
Christian doctrine may be more conducive to the formation of deep
attachments than the Judaic code. This is not to deny that the Judaic
code extends to friendship: Tubal makes determined efforts to locate
Jessica and Lorenzo on Shylock's behalf, and, perhaps in an attempt to
console his friend, takes it upon himself to examine Antonio's financial
circumstances and even to manage his arrest (3.1.79-130). However,
Shylock would never accept that an old friendship might naturally be
valued above a relatively untried marital relationship.</p>
<p>Gratiano and Nerissa resemble Jessica more than their Christian peers in
their spirited willingness to attempt to force their friends to face
unpalatable truths (compare 1.1.73-104 and 1.2.1-33). By contrast,
Bassanio soothingly dismisses Gratiano's impassioned &quot;exhortation&quot; of
Antonio (1.1.113-18), while, as we have seen, Portia eventually turns
her scolding of Bassanio to a jest. Ironically, Gratiano, who hates
Shylock more intensely than any of his peers, actually resembles him
more than he does his fellow Christians both in his direct assertiveness
and his fierce, frankly retributive anger. When Portia invites Antonio
to show mercy, he interjects, &quot;A halter gratis--nothing else, for God
sake&quot; (4.1.379; see also 4.1.364-67, 4.1.398-400). As with Shylock, this
anger reflects the depth of his attachments.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">[57]</a></sup> It is perhaps
significant that his exasperation with Shylock in the court scene, which
is even more intense than Bassanio's, although he owes Antonio no
financial obligation, drives him to echo the Jew's own reverential
allusions to Daniel, the most famously just prophet of the Old Testament
(4.1.333-34, 4.1.340-41). Gratiano is too passionate to be satisfied by
a code which promotes &quot;[un]strained&quot; mercy.</p>
<p>Gratiano's sturdy pursuit of justice is, however, limited by his tribal
instincts. He takes the usual Christian view, which Solanio, Launcelot,
Antonio and Lorenzo all share, that Shylock is beyond the pale,
&quot;currish&quot; rather than human: &quot;thy desires are wolvish, bloody, starv'd,
and ravenous&quot; (4.1.128-38; see 2.8.4, 2.8.14, 2.2.1-32, 1.3.111-12,
2.4.33-37). His stock word both for Shylock and Jessica--even after her
conversion--is &quot;infidel&quot; (4.1.334, 3.2.217). This attitude no doubt
encourages him to help Lorenzo to elope with Jessica and steal her
father's gold (2.4.28-39). The same capacity to form passionate
attachments which leads him to behave justly with his friends drives him
to identify himself closely with those who share his culture, and to
ostracise those whose mores differ from his own.</p>
<p>Although the courtroom scene obviously highlights the tribal divisions
in the play most clearly, it is Launcelot who embodies them in their
most unvarnished form: he leaves Shylock on the grounds that he is &quot;the
very devil incarnation,&quot; refuses to accept that Jessica can be anything
but &quot;damn'd,&quot; and feels no responsibility towards &quot;the Moor&quot; whom he
impregnates (2.2.1-32, 3.5.1-42). Even Portia's judgements are
ultimately limited in the same way -although she perhaps foreshadows
some of the advantages of post-Christian liberalism in her ready
acceptance of Jessica and her willingness to give Shylock several
chances to show mercy (3.4.37-39, 4.1.182-261). As we have seen, she
rejects several suitors, some of whom might have proved more trustworthy
than Bassanio, mainly because of cultural differences, and is repelled
by &quot;all of [Morocco's] complexion&quot; (1.2.39-91, 2.7.78-79). Portia, and
even the level-headed Nerissa, agree that Bassanio, &quot;of all the men that
ever my foolish eyes look'd upon, was the best deserving a fair lady,&quot;
partly, one suspects, because he is the only suitor who comports himself
in a relatively familiar way (1.2.117-21; see section 1 above).</p>
<p>Shylock himself resembles Gratiano in his tribalism as well as in his
passionate sense of justice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">[58]</a></sup> Undoubtedly, he hates Antonio in part
simply &quot;for he is a Christian,&quot;: the merchant's willingness to
&quot;lend...out money gratis&quot; is only the most egregiously exasperating
element of his otherness (1.3.42-47). Shylock robustly reciprocates the
prejudice which he experiences: he illustrates the arbitrary
divisiveness of conventional beliefs when he tells Bassanio at first
that he will not &quot;eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you,&quot; lest
he &quot;smell pork&quot; (1.3.32-38). His upbraiding of &quot;Christian husbands&quot; for
their infidelity is, as we have seen, partly justified, but at the same
time he does not credit the loyal attachment to Antonio which leads
Gratiano in particular, who owes his friend nothing but grateful care,
to risk disrupting his marriage by ceding Nerissa's ring. He would
surely never come to terms with the fact that Jessica has &quot;fled with a
Christian,&quot; even if Lorenzo proved to be the most caring and faithful
husband imaginable (2.8.16).</p>
<p>Shylock undoubtedly takes some pride in sharply distinguishing himself
from the Christians, who he feels would have him become a &quot;soft and
dull-ey'd fool&quot; like themselves, habitually willing &quot;to shake the head,
relent, and sigh, and yield&quot; (3.3.14-15). He interprets Jessica's
elopement through the lens of Jewish history and tribal identity: &quot;The
curse never fell upon our nation till now&quot; (3.1.85-86). Although, if the
above argument is correct, his pride may ultimately serve a more useful
purpose than that of Antonio and Portia, since it has been sublimated by
a faith which usually reinforces attachments, it is still quite divisive
on an intercultural level. His prejudices certainly contribute to his
ultimate determination to take his pound of flesh, thus punishing the
Christians generically, as it were, without concerning himself too
closely with individual culpability -although, as we have seen, those
whom he particularly torments did indeed probably help Lorenzo and
Jessica to carry out their unscrupulous plan. In sum, the proud
allegiance to their respective tribes which both the Christian and the
Jewish characters frequently display drives them to discriminate against
those who do not share their conventional manners and beliefs.</p>
<p>Full obedience to the injunction inscribed on the silver casket would
require one to transcend such cultural allegiances. The only character
in the play who does so is Arragon, who declares that the lead casket
&quot;shall look fairer ere I give or hazard,&quot; and rejects the gold as
representing the desires of &quot;the fool multitude that choose by show, not
learning more than the fond eye doth teach&quot; (2.9.20-33). Arragon
understands that the silver casket principle would transform society
radically, if it were carried through to a logical conclusion: &quot;How many
then should cover that stand bare? How many be commanded that command?&quot;
(2.9.44-49). According to the above argument, not only the relatively
low status Gratiano--who is twice patronisingly criticised by Bassanio,
and defers to the latter when he wishes to marry his wife's waiting
gentle-woman (1.1.114-18, 2.2.180-98, 3.5.189-195; see also
5.1.263-66)--but the generally despised Shylock might &quot;command,&quot; if
society were regulated by those who genuinely possess &quot;the stamp of
merit,&quot; rather than by those, like Bassanio and Lorenzo perhaps, whose
&quot;estates, degrees, and offices have been &quot;deriv'd corruptly&quot;
(2.9.38-49).</p>
<p>The example of Arragon indicates that silver casket values need to be
completed by philosophy, which alone can expose the arbitrariness of
many customary opinions. Arragon's radical version of these values would
presumably involve discarding the habitual beliefs which, while often
promoting justice within particular communities, tend to divide
communities from each other. It may be significant that he seems to hail
from a region of Spain which had for centuries experienced Islamic
rule.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">[59]</a></sup> Although Aragon became the last of such regions to impose
Christian conversion in 1525, a large number of Muslims continued to
practise their religion clandestinely. Here, Arragon would have been
given the same chance to compare Christianity with a religion that is
based on the Old Testament which Shakespeare offers his own audiences
and readers.</p>
<p>One of Portia's early suitors, the County Palentine, who bids fair to be
a &quot;weeping philosopher,&quot; perhaps embodies the natural justice of the
philosophically minded when he &quot;frown[s], as who should say, 'And you
will not have me, choose'&quot;: Portia fails to recognise that he is the
only one of her suitors who might be able to moderate his desire for her
beauty and wealth sufficiently to refrain from taking the casket test,
if he felt that she could never love him (1.2.45-53).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the poem contained in the silver casket does not, as one
might have imagined, argue in Portia's manner for prioritising
&quot;[un]strained&quot; love over justice, but simply points out that truly
just judgements can only be made by those few who are able and willing
to take great pains to do so, a process which is implicitly compared to
the repeated firing whereby silver is eventually purged of its
impurities: &quot;The fire seven times tried this: seven times tried that
judgment is, that did never choose amiss&quot; (2.9.63-65). Perhaps Portia's
father strove to ensure that his daughter married a sincere Christian
only because he knew that philosophers were so rare. He betrays his
underlying sympathy with those who choose the silver casket, whether for
philosophical or religious reasons, by allowing them to contravene the
conditions of the test and &quot;take what wife [they] will to bed&quot;
(2.9.11-13, 2.9.70).</p>
<p>Like Portia's father, perhaps, and like Arragon, whose vision of a
perfectly just society is more of a thought experiment than a call for
radical change, Shakespeare accepts that society has to operate at
several removes from absolute justice, since it is inevitably regulated
by common opinions. By apparently celebrating the lead casket, the play
endorses Portia's father's implicit view that, given the scarcity of
philosophers, the Christian faith has its uses. Although we have seen
that in many instances the lead casket principle may easily collapse
into the gold, characters like Antonio, or Portia herself, who represent
the minority who take seriously the injunction &quot;to give and hazard all,&quot;
do at least eschew the basest and most divisive forms of self-love, and
so, with all the caveats outlined in the first section, are still more
likely to form lasting attachments than those who simply seek to &quot;gain
what many men desire.&quot; Indeed, as Portia's father perhaps realised, two
Christians who scrupulously follow the lead casket principle, and so
&quot;bear an egall yoke of love,&quot; will, almost despite themselves, generally
fulfil their repressed desire to see their care justly requited
(3.4.13). Ironically, Shakespeare's reticence regarding the real nature
of justice could thus itself be seen as just.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the play covertly suggests that Judaism is generally more
likely to provide a dim echo of Arragon's revolutionary vision than
Christianity. It is significant that, apart from Arragon, Shylock is the
only character who is occasionally capable of appreciating the radical
implications of the silver casket principle. In his most famous speech,
he invokes an innate principle of justice which transcends cultural
differences: after reminding his Christian audience that his &quot;hands,
organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions&quot; are the same as
theirs, he insists, correctly as it turns out, that, despite their
artificial &quot;humility,&quot; they too would soon give vent to natural
indignation if they were &quot;wrong[ed]&quot; as he has been (3.1.59-73). In
the courtroom scene, moreover, he imagines the disruption which would
ensue if his Christian audience should begin to treat their slaves as
equals: &quot;Marry them to your heirs! Why sweat they under burthens? Let
their beds be made as soft as yours...&quot; (4.1.90-96). It is not
surprising that Shylock is more open to such radical ideas than the
Christians, since he has been habituated to a moral code which enshrines
justice as its key principle. It is relevant to recall that Shylock's
treatment of Launcelot is probably fair, despite the latter's complaints
(2.5.46-48, see 2.5.3-5, 2.2.106-07, 2.2.1-32). Furthermore, if the
above interpretation of the pound of flesh contract is correct, then it
is Shylock rather than the Christians who attempts to engineer a
reconciliation between the two communities.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Shakespeare uses the music of the spheres to symbolise the pervasive,
lasting satisfaction which, according to his intuition, may be gained
when souls unite in a perfectly harmonious, trusting intimacy. The
symbol suggests both that this satisfaction can be supremely fulfilling
if pursued whole-heartedly and that it is sufficiently calm and
unobtrusive to be overshadowed at times by more vivid stimuli, which
appeal to self-love and sensual desire. Jessica shows her underlying
appreciation of the equitable exchanges of care which deep attachments
naturally demand when she hopes that Bassanio will be led to attempt to
match Portia's virtues by his desire to obtain &quot;the joys of heaven here
on earth&quot; (3.5.73-83). Gratiano's determination to &quot;sweat again, and
swear till [his] very roof was dry with oaths of love&quot; in order to get
&quot;a promise...to have [Nerissa's] love&quot; indicates that truly passionate
lovers may only earn their beloveds' trust by showing self-controlled
devotion, while his mistress's insistence that he should do so
illustrates the strength of the natural urge to ensure that love is
requited in this way (3.2.203-08). Jessica and Nerissa understand that
moderate and prudent interactions of this sort, involving both &quot;the
head&quot; and &quot;the heart&quot; are likely to generate a much more intimate,
trusting union than the intense but ephemeral gratifications of a purely
sensual &quot;fancy&quot; (3.2.63-71). This transactional approach to attachments
is encapsulated in the phrase inscribed on the silver casket: &quot;Who
chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.&quot;</p>
<p>It is significant that it is left to the Jewish Jessica to draw an
explicit link between deep attachments and &quot;an upright life.&quot; Her remark
that, &quot;if on earth [Bassanio] do not merit&quot; the &quot;blessing&quot; of Portia,
&quot;in reason he should never come heaven,&quot; suggests that the natural
imperatives of love outlined in the paragraph above may often be
reinforced by religious traditions which enshrine justice as the primary
virtue (3.5.75-78). The contrast between Bassanio's decision to give
Portia's ring to 'Balthazar' and Shylock's determination to cherish the
ring that Leah gave him even after his wife's death, suggests that the
Jewish characters are more likely than the Christians to see love as
imposing a binding set of duties. The very intensity of Shylock's fury
with Jessica might remind us that, quite apart from his deep-rooted
attachment to her, he has been schooled to believe that care should
always be requited by children as dutifully as it is delivered by
parents. Similarly, although Jessica's initial determination to advance
herself at her father's expense indicates that even the combined effect
of natural attachment and conventional belief is not always proof
against the vivid enticements of ambition and sensual desire, the
bitterness of her subsequent guilt provides a measure, not only of her
underlying bond with Shylock, but of the enduring influence exerted by
her habituation to a code of pious duty.</p>
<p>&quot;Get[ting] as much as [one] deserves&quot; is implicitly offered as a
resolution to the play's underlying dialectic. Whereas the lead casket
principle is largely conventional, while the gold simply represents the
baser elements of human nature, the silver yokes together the
deep-seated natural needs and the conventional beliefs which encourage
the just exchanges of dutiful care that satisfy those needs. The silver
casket stands for an equitable balance between the one-sided
&quot;giv[ing]&quot; and &quot;gain[ing]&quot; of the other two caskets. Once the
underlying argument of the play is understood, Jewish money-lending
takes on a broader significance: usury may be distinguished on the one
hand from Lorenzo and Bassanio's unmerited financial &quot;gain,&quot; since it
involves a degree of shrewdly taken risk, not to mention the laborious
acquisition of a principal, and on the other from the apparently
unconditional &quot;giv[ing]&quot; of Antonio and Portia, since it is explicitly
designed to secure a profit. Shylock certainly pursues his own interests
much more overtly than Antonio, but at the same time he knows that, in
order to satisfy his various needs, whether personal or professional, he
must invest both his &quot;well-won thrift&quot; and his dutiful care. While he is
also prepared to make generous advances, even to enemies, these
&quot;ventures,&quot; to use a term which recurs several times in the play, are by
no means purely altruistic, but are designed to win gratitude and trust.</p>
<p>However, even as the Judaic code reinforces attachments, it foments
intercultural divisions, as any robust faith is bound to do. The same
can be true of Christianity of course, as is made clear by the racial
prejudice which Shylock experiences throughout the play -although the
liberal laws which guarantee the rights of Jewish money-lenders, not to
mention Portia's warm treatment of Jessica, appear to foreshadow an era
of post-Christian tolerance. Some of these divisions are admittedly
substantial--indeed, the play suggests that the differences between the
Christian and Judaic faiths affect the way in which their adherents
approach their deepest attachments--but others seem quite petty, as when
Shylock's habitual eschewal of pork initially prevents him from
accepting Bassanio's invitation to dinner. At this level, doctrinal
differences may be viewed simply as particularly authoritative instances
of the superficial 'otherness' which Portia finds so repellent in her
various foreign suitors.</p>
<p>These divisions are bound to obscure true merit. The portrayal of
Arragon suggests that the silver casket principle may only be followed
with absolute rigour by philosophers, since they alone can avoid being
distracted by arbitrary customs. Nevertheless, since philosophy is
inevitably restricted to the few who are sufficiently curious to allow
their judgement to be &quot;seven times tried,&quot; Portia's father has seemingly
decided that it must be left to Christianity to support, however
imperfectly, the natural desire to secure lasting attachments
(2.9.63-65). Perhaps the casket test might actually have achieved its
goal if Portia had not interfered, since one might suppose that two
Christians who are equally prepared to &quot;give and hazard all&quot; would
indeed be able to establish the equitable exchanges of care which
sustain fulfilling attachments.</p>
<p>Portia and Antonio seem to exemplify the few who seriously attempt to
regulate their lives by the lead casket principle, or in Portia's case,
by a secularised version of the doctrine, which in many ways foreshadows
modern liberalism. However, although this principle undoubtedly
encourages them to eschew the baser varieties of self-love which drive
many of their peers, it tends to be detrimental to deep attachments
-except perhaps between lovers who happen to share a determination to
&quot;give and hazard all&quot; in the manner described above. Neither Portia nor
Antonio can establish a fully intimate relationship with Bassanio,
precisely because they both allow him to exploit their generosity
without concertedly demanding a return. Whereas Shylock takes pride in
adhering to a code of duty which reinforces equitable attachments,
Portia and Antonio's effort to distinguish themselves through their pure
altruism constantly &quot;wear[ies]&quot; them, since it impedes them from
engaging in the reciprocal exchanges of care which may gradually deepen
trust.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as is entirely natural, Antonio and Portia both eventually
feel compelled to attempt to secure a return for their care for
Bassanio: Antonio constantly eminds him of his obligations, while Portia
rebukes him for his infidelity. However, the pride which both characters
habitually take in their own selfless altruism conflicts with this
natural urge, rendering these efforts insufficiently direct and forceful
to generate the mutually trusting intimacy for which they yearn. Both
thus seem fated to oscillate uneasily between the silver casket and the
lead. This point is underlined in the courtroom, where they show an
entirely natural indignation, which conflicts with their conventional
conviction that mercy should override justice. The combination of these
two motives leads Antonio to treat Shylock relatively leniently in
material terms, in that he allows him both to live and to preserve half
&quot;the means whereby [he] live[s],&quot; while at the same time punishing
him with egregious harshness in emotional terms by forcing him to
convert to Christianity and will all his money to Jessica and Lorenzo
(4.1.347-90).</p>
<p>Not only does the unconditional generosity which both Portia and Antonio
show to Bassanio create seemingly irremediable fault-lines in their own
attachments, but it enables that &quot;prodigal&quot; adventurer to pursue &quot;what
many men desire&quot; in a manner which is limited only by his own underlying
sense of justice. The pervasive decadence of Venice points to the way in
which Christian doctrine may ultimately serve to emancipate self-love.
Launcelot's fragmented family and serial affairs furnish the most
egregious example of the loosening of bonds that may occur once the
commandments to honour one's parents and refrain from adultery have been
replaced by the injunction to &quot;give and hazard all,&quot; which encourages a
generous forgiveness of potentially divisive faults. Launcelot is
typical of those who might fall victim to the gold casket in the liberal
climate which this principle promotes, in that his self-regard deprives
him of the ability to form deep attachments, while offering him in
return only transient physical pleasure and the insubstantial
gratifications of social status: &quot;Many a man his life has sold, but my
outside to behold.&quot;</p>
<p>Like Antonio and Portia, however, Lorenzo and Bassanio are also moved by
a desire to give and &quot;get as much as [they] deserve;&quot; inevitably so,
perhaps, since this desire is firmly rooted in the very nature of
attachments. Their continuing efforts to ingratiate themselves with
Jessica and Portia respectively suggest that, having satisfied their
acquisitiveness and desire to display a &quot;swelling port,&quot; they both
subsequently hope to earn the trust upon which intimate attachments must
be founded. As is implied in act 5 through the images of candle-light
and music, both natural and divine, the yearning to form lasting,
trusting attachments exercises a constant, unobtrusive influence, which
cannot be permanently overshadowed by the vivid inducements of self-love
and sensual desire.</p>
<p>Yet while these efforts certainly illustrate the enduring power of the
innate urges represented by the silver casket to counter the equally
pervasive enticements of the gold casket, they seem doomed to be
frustrated. Just as the gestures which Gobbo and Launcelot make towards
atonement and retribution respectively are shown to fall far short of
what would be needed in order to achieve a true reconciliation, so the
play encourages us to criticise Lorenzo and Bassanio's assumption that
they can establish a trusting intimacy with their respective wives
without even acknowledging, far less atoning for, the self-love which
gave these relationships their initial impetus. Ironically, these
Christians' faith in the power of &quot;[un]strained&quot; love leads them to
attempt to bypass the imperatives that naturally govern intimate
relationships, which demand a proportionately rigorous expiation of any
failure to provide self-denying care. Having been habituated to a
culture which, far from explicitly stigmatising their baser desires,
encourages them to believe that all may be forgiven in the end, Bassanio
and Lorenzo seem fated to oscillate perpetually between the gold and the
silver casket, rather as Antonio and Portia oscillate between the lead
and the silver.</p>
<p>Thus, in their different ways the Christian characters almost all fall
victim to the liberal teaching of the lead casket: this teaching helps
to deprive Launcelot, Bassanio and Gratiano of the restraints which
might have encouraged them to live a sufficiently &quot;upright life&quot; to earn
the trust of their wives, while at the same time artificially stunting
Portia and Antonio's natural sense that they have a right to demand a
return for their care. In both these cases Christian doctrine is
detrimental to the formation of deep attachments -although the
deep-seated urge to form such attachments constantly moderates both the
self-love of the former group of characters and the unconditional
generosity of the latter. By contrast, ironically, Jewish culture, which
might seem &quot;strained&quot; and rigidly hierarchical when compared to the
liberalism which the Christian doctrine of unconditional love promotes,
nevertheless generally supports deep attachments, since it seeks to
enforce the equitable exchanges of dutiful care which they demand. The
only area in which the Christian faith might be more conducive than the
Judaic to the formation of deep attachments is friendship, since the
Jewish faith, as it is portrayed in the play, automatically prioritises
marital vows above all other bonds in a manner that seems entirely
conventional.</p>
<p>One may tease out a hierarchy of regulatory principles from the play,
ranked according to extent to which they are conducive to the equitable
exchanges of care which promote deep intimacy. At the apex is Arragon's
philosophical understanding of justice, which allows him to recognise
true merit in any context. This understanding is dimly reflected in the
Jewish faith, which, although encrusted with arbitrary and divisive
customs, nevertheless reinforces personal bonds by commanding its
adherents to care for each other equitably in a restrained and dutiful
manner. On the same level, Nerissa and Gratiano show that a minority of
passionate Christians will also naturally feel impelled to ignore the
lead casket injunction and strive to ensure that their love is requited,
even if they too are unable free themselves from a divisive tribalism.
On the next level down, we have Portia and Antonio, whose faith
reinforces their determination to care for their beloveds, but at the
same time leads them to attempt to repress their natural desire to see
this care returned. Beneath these again, we have Christians like
Bassanio and Lorenzo, who are influenced by the injunction to &quot;give and
hazard all&quot; only to the extent that it side-lines the ten commandments,
and encourages them to feel that divisive faults will easily be
forgiven. Such characters are nevertheless still partly swayed by
gratitude and a belated guilt, but only because these emotions are
embedded in the very nature of lasting attachments. At the bottom of
this scale is Launcelot, whose self-love and sensual desire have been so
thoroughly emancipated by the liberal culture to which he has been
habituated as almost to deprive him altogether of the capacity to form
deep attachments. It should be remembered, however, that even Launcelot
asks his father to bless him, and, moreover, remains humbly kneeling for
an extended period while he does so.</p>
<p>If the above argument is correct, Shakespeare clearly needs to disguise
his real views even more carefully than usual in this play, since his
main aim is to show that the central Christian doctrine is generally
detrimental to the pursuit of what he conceives to be the ultimate good.
It would of course have been imprudent to have explicitly celebrated the
virtues of the silver casket at the expense of the lead, or perhaps even
to have shown us enough of Shylock's domestic life, or of the softer
feelings which underlie his gruff, sardonic self-assertion, to invite
unqualified sympathy. The comedy of the final wrangling over the rings
allows many in the audience to lay aside both their sympathy for Shylock
and any criticisms which they may have formed of the Christians.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">[60]</a></sup>
Shakespeare offers Bassanio as the handsome hero in what one critic has
described as &quot;a gilded world...of luxury and leisure, of idle talk and
frivolity, of music and romance,&quot; while inviting audiences to forget the
very existence of the man who ultimately provided him with the money to
pursue his ambitions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">[61]</a></sup> Similarly, Lorenzo's poetic and romantic
evocation of the music of the spheres seems calculated to distract many
in the audience from the economic imperatives which originally drove him
to elope with Jessica. We are reminded of these only at the very end of
the play when he welcomes Shylock's enforced deed of gift as &quot;manna&quot; for
&quot;starved people&quot; (5.1.294-95).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">[62]</a></sup> Quite apart from his concern to
protect himself, Shakespeare perhaps considers that any attempt to bring
about the radical changes which are explored by Arragon would be
dangerously disruptive. Beyond either of these prudential motives,
however, his multi-levelled rhetorical strategy also serves a positive,
erotic purpose, namely to provide food for thought for those readers who
take delight in having their judgements &quot;seven times tried.&quot;</p>
