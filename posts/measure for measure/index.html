            <h1>Introduction: The &quot;Stew&quot; of Vienna</h1>
<p>It is easy to forget that the play starts from the premise that Viennese
society is being radically disrupted by a general moral decadence:</p>
<p>There is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must
cure it. Novelty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is only in request, and, as it is, as dangerous to be ag'd in any kind
of course, as it is</p>
<p>virtuous to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth
enough alive to</p>
<p>make societies secure, but security enough to make fellowships
accurs'd. (3.2.222-</p>
<p>28)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a natural need for the &quot;security&quot; which lasting &quot;fellowships&quot;
provide: even Lucio, who is one of the main culprits, relies on
Claudio's &quot;precis[ion] in promise-keeping&quot; (1.2.74-76).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> However,
left to themselves, many seem unable to prevent themselves from being
distracted, presumably by self-love and sensual desire, from exercising
the dutiful, restrained loyalty, or &quot;truth,&quot; which is required to fulfil
this need (3.2.226-28). After his arrest Claudio himself acknowledges in
a moment of clarity that his problems stem from &quot;too much liberty&quot;:</p>
<p>As surfeit is the father of much fast,</p>
<p>So every scope by the immoderate use</p>
<p>Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,</p>
<p>Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,</p>
<p>A thirsty evil, and when we drink we die. (1.2.128-30)</p>
<p>Thus, Shakespeare suggests that desires which are as natural as &quot;eating
and drinking,&quot; as Lucio and others frequently point out, may
nevertheless prove to be dangerous both to oneself and others if
indulged in immoderately (3.2.102-03, 3.2.174-76, 2.1.230-35, 2.2.5-6).</p>
<p>The old laws aimed to safeguard the &quot;security&quot; which families naturally
require by imposing conventional restraints on sensual desire--chief
among which is of course the institution of marriage--which are
underwritten by legal deterrents. It should be remembered that Juliet's
famous namesake, who only even goes as far as confessing her love by
accident, is immediately concerned to guarantee Romeo's fidelity by
marrying him.</p>
<p>The most concrete example of the harm which unrestrained desire may
cause is venereal disease. The second gentleman has
&quot;purchas'd...diseases&quot; amounting to &quot;three thousand dolors a year&quot; at
Mistress Overdone's brothel, and his two interlocutors seem to be in
much the same situation (1.2.5-59; see also 3.2.56-60). More broadly,
events bear out the Duke's contention that sexual immorality in
particular &quot;is too general a vice, and severity must cure it&quot;
(3.2.99-100). The incident in which Elbow's pregnant wife is groped by
Froth, who mistakes her for a prostitute when she is attempting to buy
stewed prunes at an inn which, unbeknownst to her, turns out to be one
of the many brothels in Vienna, furnishes a small but significant
example of the way in which ordinary family life is being disrupted by a
&quot;corruption&quot; that &quot;boil[s] and bubble[s] till it o'errun the stew&quot;
(2.1.75-169, 5.1.318-19). The portrayal of Pompey, who is evidently just
one of the many bawds who batten on the burgeoning sex trade in Vienna,
demonstrates how self-love often mingles with immoderate sensuality to
form this chaotic &quot;stew&quot; (1.2.95-105).</p>
<p>Lucio provides the most sustained illustration of a society in which
&quot;too much liberty&quot; has degraded the &quot;truth,&quot; or dutiful loyalty, upon
which lasting attachments depend (3.2.204). Claudio twice refers to
Lucio as his &quot;friend,&quot; but, far from showing the loyal care which
friendship usually entails, Lucio's efforts to protect Claudio from
execution are mainly motivated by a fear that he himself &quot;would stand
under grievous imposition&quot; if Angelo's strict regime were to go
unchallenged (1.2.142, 1.2.192, 1.2.187-91). By contrast, he has nothing
to gain by keeping Pompey out of prison, and so shamelessly rebuffs the
pimp's repeated requests for bail, even though he is not only one of the
latter's long-standing customers, but has long been considered a
&quot;friend&quot; (3.2.40-85). His most egregiously inconstant act is to inform
against Mrs. Overdone, no doubt in the hope of ingratiating himself with
the new regime, even though she is generously looking after his own
child, whose mother is a &quot;punk&quot; whom he promised to marry (3.2.198-203,
4.4.169-74, 5.1.508-523). Pompey's jokes about hanging Abhorson, who has
promised to teach him his deadly &quot;trade,&quot; and thus enable the pimp to
escape &quot;imprisonment&quot; and &quot;an unpitied whipping,&quot; show a similar level
of insouciant ingratitude (4.2.54-59, 4.2.8-14).</p>
<p>The shameless Lucio is a stranger not only to the restraints which deep
attachments naturally impose, but to Christian conceptions of virtue, as
we may infer from his mockery of Isabella's determination to renounce
the world and enter a convent (1.4.31-38, 1.4.57-61). We may infer from
his slandering of the Duke and his constant interruptions in the final
scene that he respects the authority of the ancien regime as little as
he fears God or dishonour (3.2.116-84, 4.4.161-62, 5.1.78-87,
5.1.188-92, 5.1.214-15, 5.1.283-86, 5.1.304). The play indicates that
the only force which can &quot;secure&quot; societies against the depredations of
such men is fear of the law's &quot;grievous imposition&quot; (1.2.187-89). It is
this nagging fear that drives Lucio to enrol Isabella to plead Claudio's
cause, and subsequently to urge her insistently to do so in the most
emotive manner possible (1.4.24-90, 2.2.109-32).</p>
<p>Sexual immorality is symptomatic of a broader decadence in Vienna, in
which &quot;liberty plucks justice by the nose; the baby beats the nurse, and
quite athwart goes all decorum&quot; (1.3.29-31; see below). It should be
remembered that Pompey is a thief as well as a pimp (3.2.15-18). Apart
from theft and prostitution, the crimes and misdemeanours of those who
have recently been imprisoned under Angelo's regime range from unpaid
debt to assault and murder (4.3.1-19). Although Shakespeare makes this
point clear for those who wish to consider its implications, he
relegates it to the subplot. I would suggest that he focuses on sexual
immorality in the play, partly because it seems to be a sufficiently
trivial matter to be treated mercifully in the end without disturbing
either his audience's natural sense of justice or the conventions of
comedy--for his aim is to invite some readers and viewers to contemplate
the function of the laws and the forces that obstruct that function,
rather than to transform society--and partly because such immorality is
more directly detrimental to the &quot;truth&quot; which sustains families and
&quot;fellowships&quot; than many other apparently more egregious vices.</p>
<h1>Christianity and the Law</h1>
<p>The effectiveness of the arguments which the wily Duke uses to induce
Angelo to abandon his life of &quot;study and fast&quot; in order to endeavour to
control this &quot;fever on goodness&quot; confirms that his claim to have &quot;fully
unfolded&quot; the &quot;history&quot; of his deputy's &quot;character&quot; is largely
well-founded (1.4.57-61, 1.1.26-29). The Duke starts by arguing that
Angelo's apparently self-denying regimen is in reality highly
self-indulgent: &quot;Thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper
as to waste thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee&quot; (1.1.29-35). This
suggestion that God expects the souls that He has created to show their
gratitude by making themselves useful in the world prepares the way for
a covert appeal to the intense, restless desire for &quot;honors&quot; which the
Duke recognises to be Angelo's unacknowledged ruling passion: his spirit
is &quot;finely touch'd...to fine issues;&quot; is capable of &quot;excellence;&quot; and
can earn &quot;glory&quot; for his Creator -but also, implicitly, for himself
(1.1.52, 1.1.35-40). The Duke understands that his new deputy's
self-regard cannot be acknowledged openly, since his piety demands that
it manifests itself as humble self-denial. It is only later, once Angelo
has abandoned his desire to distinguish himself by his &quot;gravity,&quot; that
he can admit to himself that both his recent entry into politics and, by
implication, his former &quot;studie[s]&quot; have always been motivated by
&quot;pride&quot; (2.4.7-12).</p>
<p>Angelo's desire to distinguish himself is easily redirected into
politics because the Duke's pious arguments enable him to savour, albeit
in an entirely unacknowledged manner, the prospect of winning &quot;honors,&quot;
both on earth and in heaven, which would far exceed any he might gain in
the private sphere through his ascetic regimen. We may infer from the
shrewd Vincentio's choice of Angelo as deputy that the latter's
character is particularly well suited to the task of reviving the strict
laws precisely because he combines a driving pursuit of honour with
sincere piety (see 2.4.1-5). It is his faith which enables him to ignore
the popular resentment which this project is bound to provoke in a way
that the philosophical Duke is unable to do: Angelo genuinely wishes to
win &quot;glory&quot; for, and implicitly from, God, even though, as he later
realises, he is also entranced by the &quot;awe&quot; which &quot;place&quot; and &quot;form&quot;
&quot;wrench...from fools&quot; (2.4.12-15).</p>
<p>Despite tending to assign supreme value to the contemplative life which
Angelo has hitherto been leading, and which Isabella aspires to lead, we
are reminded that the Christian faith does provide a degree of support
for those who wish to enter public life by the Duke's allusions both to
Christ's injunction against hiding one's light under a bushel and to the
parable of the talents (1.1.29-40; see <em>Matthew</em> v 14, xxv 14). Indeed,
Christianity even offers some teachings, drawn primarily, but by no
means entirely, from the Old Testament, which enable Angelo to feel that
he is serving God by playing the lofty role of moral arbiter in a new,
much stricter regime, in which lawlessness of all types, but
particularly sexual immorality, is no longer tolerated -although, as we
shall see, these teachings go against the grain of the main body of
Christian doctrine.</p>
<p>When in post, Angelo maintains that the primary function of the law is
as a general deterrent: it is like &quot;a scarecrow,&quot; which must
occasionally move, lest &quot;birds of prey&quot; make it &quot;their perch rather than
their terror&quot; (2.1.1-4). This argument, which, as we shall see, is
initially endorsed by the Duke himself, demands that retribution must be
a public affair: Angelo successfully causes wide-spread consternation by
issuing a &quot;proclamation&quot; that the brothels &quot;must be pluck'd down,&quot; while
ensuring that wrongdoers like Claudio are &quot;show[n]...to th' world&quot;
before they are led to prison (1.3.19-28, 1.2.60-119). He easily
counters Escalus's pleas for clemency for Claudio, which are based on
the argument that he too could easily have erred in the same way if he
had had the opportunity, since he is subject to the same &quot;affections&quot;
(2.1.8-16). Angelo tells Escalus firstly that &quot;'tis one thing to be
tempted...another thing to fall,&quot; but then adds, crucially, that even if
he were himself corrupt, he could still ensure that the law fulfilled
its vital purpose as a deterrent. From a political point of view, it
does not matter much that the law is a fairly blunt instrument in
individual terms: &quot;What's open made to justice, that justice seizes.
What knows the laws that thieves do pass on thieves&quot; (2.1.17-26).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Isabella succeeds in undermining Angelo's resolution where Escalus
fails, purely, it seems, because she gives the latter's argument an
explicitly Christian twist. She demonstrates eloquently that Angelo's
stern efforts to revive the old laws are ultimately impossible to
reconcile with the humility which Christian doctrine demands. &quot;Proud
man, dress'd in a little brief authority,&quot; who callously condemns
others, &quot;like an angry ape, play[ing]...fantastic tricks before high
heaven,&quot; has a nature which is as &quot;glassy,&quot; that is, brittle or
unreliable, as those whom he condemns: &quot;authority, though it err like
others, hath yet a kind of medicine in itself, that skins the vice o'
th' top&quot; (2.2.110-24, 2.2.134-39). Moreover, it is iniquitous for &quot;souls
that...were forfeit once&quot; through original sin to judge others more
harshly than they are themselves judged by a merciful Redeemer: &quot;How
would you be if He, which is the top of judgment, should but judge you
as you are?&quot; (2.2.73-79). Isabella's arguments reflect the Christian
tendency to internalise both virtue and vice: however virtuous his
actual conduct might be, Angelo's judgement of Claudio is invalidated by
original sin, or a &quot;natural guiltiness,&quot; as he would doubtless discover
if he examined his own &quot;heart&quot; carefully (2.2.136-41). According to the
dominant strand of Christian doctrine, the primary vice is a proud
refusal to admit to one's own innate &quot;guiltiness,&quot; like &quot;the unwedgeable
and gnarled oak,&quot; while the primary virtue is a humble reliance on
Christ's mercy (2.2.116).</p>
<p>At first, as befits a man who has &quot;studied&quot; the &quot;state&quot; carefully for
many years, Angelo's response to Isabella is, if anything, even more
sturdy and convincing than his refutation of Escalus's arguments
(2.4.7-8). His defence of the political function of the old laws is both
earnest and cogent. The law, he avers, is like a &quot;prophet&quot; who guards
against &quot;future evils&quot; which are currently &quot;in progress to be hatch'd
and born&quot;: there are many who &quot;had not dar'd to do...evil if the first
that did th' edict infringe had answer'd for his deed&quot; (2.2.91-99).
Paradoxically, by enforcing the old laws with the utmost severity,
Angelo is in fact showing a compassion that extends far beyond
individual cases: &quot;for then I pity those I do not know, which a
dismiss'd offense would after gall&quot; (2.2.100-02).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> I would argue that
this defence of the deterrent function of the law is fully endorsed by
Shakespeare.</p>
<p>The wordplay in Angelo's aside, &quot;She speaks, and 'tis such sense that my
sense breeds with it,&quot; indicates that it is Isabella's words rather than
her person which catalyse and emancipate his sensual desire
(2.2.141-42). Reviewing with grim sardonicism her routine farewells,
&quot;Heaven keep your honor safe,&quot; and &quot;'Save your honor!&quot; he seems for a
moment to recognise that the threat is &quot;from thee: even from thy virtue.
What's this? What's this? Is this her fault or mine? The tempter, or the
tempted, who sins most, ha?&quot; (2.2.147-63). He could indeed be said to
&quot;sin in loving virtue,&quot; since he is in the process of being corrupted,
not primarily by sensual desire, or &quot;power,&quot; as the Duke anticipates,
but precisely by Isabella's arguments for Christian humility (2.2.182,
1.3.54). His attraction to Isabella, whom he now sees as a &quot;saint...&quot;
embodying all the Christian virtues, is inseparable from his underlying
sense that this role clashes with the humble compassion which his faith
has taught him to celebrate above all other qualities (2.2.178-80). In
this way Shakespeare hints, in an understandably indirect way, that the
doctrines which lie at the very centre of the Christian faith may
actively undermine just political authority, and therefore the rule of
law.</p>
<p>Isabella's Christian arguments apparently convince Angelo that his
nature is too sinful to be able to win &quot;glory&quot; for and from God. They
also catalyse what appears to be a pre-existing, repressed intuition on
Angelo's part that worldly &quot;place&quot; and &quot;form&quot; are insubstantial rewards
for the arduous duties of political authority: he now sees that, at
best, they merely &quot;wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls to
[a] false seeming&quot; (2.4.12-15). The conceit which he uses to explore
his overpowering excitement at Isabella's approach provides a further
hint that his attraction to her is inseparable from his impatience with
his political role, since it implies that even in the unlikely event
that the populace should show him &quot;obsequious fondness&quot; and &quot;untaught
love,&quot; he would find their advances suffocating rather than gratifying,
since he would now see them merely as feeding a futile vanity
(2.4.26-30). Angelo's sublimated pride has hitherto allowed him to rule
justly, but he is left with no substantial motive to do so, once the
doctrines which allowed him to rationalise this vanity by seeing himself
as performing the will of a just God have been undermined by Isabella's
arguments. Such a motive may exist, since one might imagine a &quot;fond
father&quot; who could steel himself to discipline those in his care purely
through love, but Angelo is clearly not moved deeply by attachments,
whether patriotic or personal (1.3.23-27).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Angelo's remorseless logic exposes the threat which Isabella's arguments
pose to the political order. He sees that a thorough-going critique of
the &quot;gravity&quot; in which, as he now admits, he &quot;take[s] pride&quot; would
involve not only releasing Claudio, but many other, much more hardened
wrongdoers: &quot;O, let her brother live! Thieves for their robbery have
authority when judges steal themselves&quot; (2.2.174-75). Although he
ultimately excepts Claudio from this programme of corrupt clemency,
purely on the grounds that the latter &quot;might in the times to come have
ta'en revenge, by so receiving a dishonor'd life,&quot; he might perhaps have
proved as lenient as the Duke if he had continued to rule, although
there is also nothing now to prevent him from behaving in a thoroughly
tyrannical manner (4.4.28-32).</p>
<p>Moreover, Isabella's arguments also lead Angelo to discard the amalgam
of piety and honour by which his own life has previously been regulated,
which has hitherto led him to &quot;stand at a guard with envy,&quot; while
pursuing &quot;profits of the mind: study and fast&quot; (2.4.7-12, 1.3.50-52,
1.4.60-61). He understands that it would be inconsistent not to extend
the same leniency to his own innately sinful nature as to the populace
as a whole: &quot;Blood thou art blood. Let's write 'good angel' on the
devil's horn&quot; (2.2.174-76). The conventional mixture of pride and piety
which initially impels Angelo both to restrain his own desires and to
seek to revive the old laws is clearly preferable to the humility and
self-knowledge which subsequently liberate his sensuality and self-love,
depriving him of a motive to rule justly, or even to control his
personal desires. Here Shakespeare seems to anticipate an enlightenment
in which artificial principles are stripped away in such a radical
manner that nothing remains to limit desire except the duties which
lasting attachments naturally generate. This is the deepest sense in
which Christian mercy may &quot;prove itself a bawd&quot; (3.1.149): the doctrines
of original sin and redemption may in the end encourage the more
thoughtful of those living in a post-Christian era to define their own
nature in the basest terms, while discarding the sublimated pride which,
as the examples of Angelo and Isabella seem to indicate, generally
reinforces moral and religious codes.</p>
<p>Just as Angelo's attraction to Isabella's apparently humble compassion
undermines the moral principles which have hitherto impelled him to
restrain himself and others, so Isabella's plea for clemency for her
brother conflicts with her own personal code of virtue. Angelo's
strategy, which is both shrewd and carefully considered (see 2.4.59-60),
exposes the fact that Isabella does not dream of applying her arguments
for a universal &quot;natural guiltiness&quot; to herself, despite her attempts to
disarm the deputy through her conventionally Christian claim to be
&quot;frail&quot; and &quot;ignorant, and in nothing good, but graciously to know I am
no better&quot; (2.2.139, 2.4.76-77, 2.4.124-38). Unlike Angelo himself,
whose position is now entirely consistent, Isabella fails to see that,
according to her own previous argument, there is no reason why anyone
should be able to restrain themselves any more reliably than they can
restrain others. She is in fact self-indulgent in the same way as the
Duke (see the concluding section of this essay), for she sets herself
higher standards than she expects others to achieve, and feels no duty
to promulgate the restraint which in reality she herself values so
highly. Short of sacrificing her own virtue in the manner that Angelo
suggests, the only way for her to avoid these inconsistencies would be
to allow that it is possible to judge others as surely as she
discriminates between sin and virtue in her personal life. Isabella
herself is eventually forced to admit that it is absurd to excuse a sin
which she herself would do anything to avoid committing, lest she should
&quot;die for ever&quot;: she is from the start &quot;at war 'twixt will and will not&quot;
in pleading for Claudio's life, and ultimately declares, &quot;To have what
we would have, we speak not what we mean. I something do excuse the
thing I hate, for his advantage that I dearly love&quot; (2.4.107-08,
2.2.29-33, 2.4.118-20).</p>
<p>In the light of his own recent epiphany, Angelo now realises that
Isabella's apparent humility conceals an egregious pride: &quot;wisdom wishes
to appear most bright when it doth tax itself&quot; (2.4.78-81). As with
Angelo himself--at least as we have hitherto seen him--Isabella's
self-regard is of course sublimated by a serious piety: when we first
meet her, she is &quot;wishing [for] a more strict restraint&quot; even than is
normally imposed on the nuns of her chosen order, who are merely
forbidden to speak while showing their faces to men (1.4.1-13). However,
just as Angelo's fundamental self-love is exposed by the Duke's
flattery, Isabella's susceptibility to Lucio's professions of admiration
for her sexual &quot;pow'r&quot;-- &quot;when maidens sue, men give like gods&quot;
(1.4.80-81)--reveals the desire for distinction which underlies her
programme of self-denial. It is relevant to note that, in the final
scene, after seemingly relishing the power that her beauty has exerted
over Angelo, she apparently gives serious consideration to the Duke's
marriage proposal (5.1.445-47, 5.1.534-37).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is not necessarily to demean either Isabella's or Angelo's virtue to
say that it is rooted in a desire for honour; indeed, Shakespeare may
well believe that all conventional moral and religious codes essentially
work by sublimating self-love in this way. Rather, the question which
this section of the play raises concerns the usefulness or otherwise of
the Christian faith in shaping that desire for just political ends. The
relationship between Lucio and Isabella on the one hand and the Duke and
Angelo on the other resembles that between the philosopher kings and
their guardians in <em>The Republic</em>, in that both the former are shrewd
atheists (see below) who are capable of manipulating pious belief. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>
However, the Christian faith is shown to be much less useful politically
than Plato's noble lie.</p>
<p>The fact that both Angelo and Isabella have to be persuaded to abandon a
purely contemplative life may remind us that Christianity values
unworldliness above political engagement. The Duke is working
largely--although, as we have seen, not entirely--against the grain of
that faith in channelling Angelo's proud piety usefully into politics,
and although Lucio is undoubtedly going with that grain when he flatters
Isabella into using the &quot;grace&quot; of her &quot;fair prayer to soften&quot; Angelo's
heart, Isabella is nevertheless able to reassure herself that she is
delaying her entry into the convent for reasons that are themselves
deeply unworldly (1.4.68-87). It is her detachment from the material
world as well as her love for her brother which encourages her to plead
for clemency for Claudio, when it is in fact against her deepest
principles to do so. When Angelo compares siring an illegitimate child
to murder, she replies that, &quot;'tis set down so in heaven, but not in
earth&quot; (2.4.50). Both Isabella and Angelo retain a residual conception
of a stern God who demands dutiful obedience in this life, while
modelling authoritative rule, but in both cases, this conception is
undermined by their faith in a redemptive saviour, who models a
compassionate humility which transcends mundane affairs.</p>
<p>Although this residual conception is conventional, it is ultimately
rooted in a natural need for justice. We witness the full force of
Isabella's innate sense of justice when she inveighs forcefully against
Angelo as soon as his &quot;pernicious purpose&quot; is revealed, abruptly
abandoning her appeal to his compassion, which involved presenting
herself, entirely disingenuously, as &quot;frail,&quot; &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;credulous&quot;
(2.4.124-54). She shows a similar fierce indignation when she brands
Claudio a &quot;beast,&quot; a &quot;faithless coward&quot; and a &quot;dishonest wretch,&quot;
declaring that he deserves to die for begging her to save his life by
&quot;bending down&quot; (3.1.132-50).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> The implication is that Christian
attempts to transcend such righteous indignation are bound to lead to
hypocrisy, since it is in fact the natural response to egregious
breaches of the &quot;truth&quot; upon which &quot;societies&quot; are founded.</p>
<p>Isabella unconsciously draws on a natural conception of justice while
pleading for mercy for Angelo in the final scene: in effect, she argues
that it would be iniquitous to execute Angelo on the grounds that &quot;a due
sincerity governed his deeds, till he did look on me,&quot; and that, as she
belatedly acknowledges, her &quot;brother had but justice, in that he did the
thing for which he died&quot; (5.1.445-49). At this point she also abandons
the internalised conception of guilt which she advanced earlier in the
play, and echoes Angelo's own contention that justice must primarily
concern itself with behaviour: &quot;His act did not o'ertake his bad
intent...Thoughts are no subjects, intents but merely thoughts&quot;
(5.1.451-54; compare 2.2.136-41, 2.1.21-26). The unacknowledged
corollary to her argument is that Angelo would in fact deserve to die if
he had not initially been &quot;sincer[e];&quot; if her brother had not in fact
broken the law; and if her own virginity had actually been taken.</p>
<p>Angelo's own behaviour in the final scene demonstrates the deep-seated
nature of the need for justice. While his first request to be allowed to
die is motivated by shame and a quasi-religious fear of the Duke's
&quot;pow'r divine&quot;--thus again reminding us of the power of codes of honour
and piety to reinforce the law--his second is much more heartfelt, since
it is triggered by a natural feeling that he has let down those, like
Escalus in particular, who, as he believes, relied upon his &quot;temper'd
judgment&quot;:</p>
<p>I am sorry that such sorrow I procure,</p>
<p>And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart</p>
<p>That I crave death more willingly than mercy:</p>
<p>'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it. (5.1.470-77; compare 5.1.366-74)</p>
<p>Angelo's sincere penitence confirms that his previous, apparently
enlightened discovery that his own nature was primarily sensual and
self-loving was in fact simply a secularised reiteration of the
conventional doctrine of original sin (see 2.4.15-17). He only comes to
understand his true nature in the speech quoted above, where he
acknowledges that he is deeply moved by sympathetic ties. Ironically, we
may infer from his overriding guilt that, despite ultimately requiring
an uncongenial severity on the part of those in authority, the legal
system is originally based on an innate need for justice, which arises
spontaneously in response to the flouting of the &quot;truth&quot; that is
required to sustain &quot;fellowships.&quot; The Christian faith causes all sorts
of disingenuousness by seeking to deny that this need runs as &quot;deep&quot; as
the human sympathies by which it is naturally generated.</p>
<p>Shakespeare uses the less obtrusive subplot to flesh out his warning
that Christian doctrine opposes the assertiveness which may be needed to
defend the state. At the start of act 1, scene 2, the first gentleman
prays for &quot;Heaven [to] grant us its peace, but not the King of
Hungary's!&quot; and goes on to maintain that &quot;there's not a soldier of us
all, that in the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition well
that prays for peace&quot; (1.2.4-5, 1.2.14-16). A truly devout Christian
soldier might well feel torn between the spirited self-assertion which
his profession demands and his faith, just as Angelo is torn between his
wish to revive the old laws and his Christian conviction that humility
and mercy are superior to proud severity. By contrast, Lucio's reference
to &quot;the sanctimonious pirate, that went to sea with the Ten
Commandements, but scrap'd one out of the table,&quot; namely, &quot;'Thou shalt
not steal,'&quot; may remind us that Old Testament laws condemn only
predatory violence (1.2.7-10). Unlike Christianity, these laws are thus
easily compatible with the use of harsh deterrents to protect the state
both from internal and external threats.</p>
<p>Shakespeare uses Escalus to reinforce the point that officials may be
prevented by their Christian convictions from enforcing justice in the
manner that their role requires:</p>
<p>Well; heaven forgive him! And forgive us all!</p>
<p>Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall;</p>
<p>Some run from brakes of ice and answer none,</p>
<p>And some condemned for a fault alone. (2.1.37-40).</p>
<p>Escalus agrees that Angelo's strictness is &quot;needful,&quot; and attempts to
ensure that Elbow's peers cannot avoid taking their turn as constables,
but, like Isabella, he prioritises the need to gain &quot;heaven['s]&quot;
forgiveness for original sin over what he perceives to be the law's
faltering and petty efforts to discriminate between virtue and vice
(2.1.282, 2.1.257-75). It is ultimately Escalus's Christian faith which
ensures that under his aegis &quot;justice dissolves in the amoralism of
nature,&quot; as one critic perceptively puts it.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> The practical effect of
his pious convictions is revealed when he baulks at arresting Pompey and
Froth, even though it is clear that they have both broken the laws which
Angelo is attempting to revive (2.1.185-256). Unlike Angelo, who simply
hopes that he will &quot;whip them all,&quot; Escalus has the patience and
experience to discriminate carefully between the law-abiding Elbow on
the one side and Pompey and Froth on the other, but he lacks a driving
motive to pursue justice (2.1.137).</p>
<p>As we have seen in the case of Angelo, this state of mind is conducive
to corruption: since Escalus releases Pompey without punishment, even
though the evidence against the bawd seems clear, we might even wonder
whether he is himself the &quot;wise burgher&quot; who preserves the high-status
brothels in the city, while allowing &quot;houses of resort in the suburbs
[to] be pull'd down&quot; (1.2.95-103). There is no doubt that he is swayed
by Claudio's &quot;noble&quot; birth, and perhaps, since he reprimands him only in
the mildest terms, by Froth's &quot;fourscore pound a year&quot; (2.1.6-7,
2.1.122-23, 2.1.193-96, 2.1.203-12). By contrast, Angelo initially
attempts to punish all breaches of the law indiscriminately, regardless
of whether they are committed in the city or the suburbs (1.2.93-96).</p>
<p>Escalus's Christian faith legitimises his natural warm-heartedness.
While, as we have seen, the need for justice runs deep on an individual
level, organised legal systems are bound to impose difficult demands on
those in authority, who are required to detach themselves from their
natural sympathy for those whom they are appointed to punish in a manner
that may be both personally uncongenial and generally unpopular. The
provost, who is himself keen to avoid having to superintend Claudio's
execution, treats Abhorson as if he were little better than a bawd, even
though the hangman clearly plays a vital role in enforcing the laws
which are designed precisely to control such immorality (2.2.7-14,
4.2.29-31). Similarly, just as the Duke appoints Angelo to revive
respect for the laws, partly in order to avoid being blamed for
&quot;tyranny&quot; if he himself should &quot;strike and gall&quot; his subjects, and
partly because he finds severity personally uncongenial, so the men in
Elbow's ward are &quot;glad&quot; to pay the latter to serve as constable, a role
which he has performed with &quot;great pains&quot; for seven and a half years:
&quot;They do you wrong to put you so oft upon't&quot; (1.3.8, 1.3.36,
2.1.257-73). Elbow's wife is slandered by Pompey for his pains, rather
as Angelo is generally reviled for his austere sternness (2.1.165-79,
1.2.120-23, 1.2.157-71, 1.4.57-61).</p>
<p>Ironically, Shakespeare leaves it to Isabella, who is the very
embodiment of Christian compassion, to make the key point that mercy may
often &quot;prove itself a bawd&quot; (3.1.149). Isabella's intervention is itself
tainted, originally by the fact that it is a consequence of Claudio's
shrewd understanding that &quot;in her youth there is a prone and speechless
dialect, such as move men,&quot; and subsequently by Lucio's eager support
(1.2.182-89). Lucio successfully subverts the new &quot;imposition[s]&quot; by
exploiting Isabella's potent combination of Christian compassion and
sexual charm: &quot;when maidens sue,&quot; he declares, &quot;men give like gods&quot; in
response to their &quot;fair prayer[s]&quot; -especially, one might add, when
they &quot;weep and kneel,&quot; while insistently reminding a male interlocutor
of his sensual nature and of their own &quot;soft[ness]&quot; and &quot;frail[ty]&quot;
(1.4.79-83, 1.4.69, 2.2.136-42, 2.4.128-30).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> In the end, as one
critic puts it, Isabella herself effectively acknowledges that &quot;the
actual role she had played with Angelo was not that of novice at all,
but that of a woman&quot; (5.1.445-47).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> Her intervention is also tainted
by her instant readiness to act the role of &quot;bare procuress&quot; in bringing
Mariana and Angelo together (3.1.197-269).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> It is no coincidence
that Isabella's passionate plea for mercy on the grounds that society
exculpates the wealthy and powerful, while condemning their social
inferiors, is echoed by Pompey when he is seeking to rationalise his
practice of &quot;buy[ing] and sell[ing] men and women like beasts&quot;
(2.2.127-31, 3.2.1-10).</p>
<p>The conversations between Angelo and Isabella link mercy to bawdiness in
another way, for it is precisely Isabella's previous plea for compassion
which leaves her with no logical way of resisting Angelo's arguments for
sleeping with him. Isabella's &quot;ignorant&quot; or, more probably, seemingly
ignorant assumption that the &quot;sin&quot; to which Angelo is obliquely
referring in his attempt to seduce her is either his own putative
forgiveness of Claudio, or her plea for leniency itself, may be intended
to hint that mercy can be as &quot;sin[ful]&quot; as the vice which it forgives
-or indeed, from a political point of view, even more so, since it
encourages the commission of innumerable &quot;future evils&quot; (2.4.60-77,
2.2.93-99). The Duke is himself clearly aware that &quot;we bid this be done,
when evil deeds have their permissive pass, and not the punishment,&quot;
while the compassionate Escalus echoes the same view: &quot;mercy is not
itself, that oft looks so; pardon is still the nurse of second woe&quot;
(1.3.37-39, 2.1.283-85). It is significant that the three characters in
the play who consistently prioritise mercy over justice all acknowledge
the dangers of this approach.</p>
<h1>Philosophy and the Law</h1>
<p>The Duke's underlying motives are revealed in the early scene in which
he explains the purpose of his temporary retirement to Friar Thomas. He
tells the friar that he expects that in his absence Angelo will revive
the old &quot;strict statutes and biting laws (the needful bits and curbs to
headstrong weeds)&quot; which are needed to rein in a lawless community,
where &quot;liberty plucks justice by the nose; the baby beats the nurse, and
quite athwart goes all decorum&quot; (1.3.19-21). Although the Duke &quot;loves
the people,&quot; as he claims, he has hitherto behaved like a &quot;fond
father...,&quot; who places &quot;threat'ning twigs of birch...in their children's
sight for terror, not to use,&quot; with the result that his rules have
eventually &quot;become...more mock'd than fear'd&quot; (1.3.23-27).
Paradoxically, it is thus precisely his reluctance to accept that the
political order cannot be sustained simply by kindness which actually
degrades the care which he can offer his subjects. The Duke's efforts to
preserve the purity of his own benevolence, while at the same time
restraining the worst excesses of the populace, lead him to behave in a
disingenuous manner which, as we shall see, is entirely characteristic:
he cannot bear even to instruct Angelo to impose rigorous sanctions, but
instead gives him the choice whether &quot;to enforce or qualify the laws;&quot;
and yet he has clearly selected a deputy who is bound to choose
&quot;mortality&quot; over &quot;mercy&quot; (1.1.64-66, 1.1.44-45).</p>
<p>The Duke certainly shows some concern for the welfare of his subjects in
at least delegating to Angelo the task of controlling the rampant
lawlessness of Vienna. In reality, however, he considers that this
strategy is unlikely to succeed, since it is probable that &quot;power&quot; will
&quot;change&quot; his deputy's &quot;purpose&quot; (1.3.54). At the same time as hoping
that Angelo's noble and pious code will encourage him to revive the
strict laws which are needed to protect the public, he fundamentally
distrusts his artificial repression of passion, which he sees as barely
disguising an egregious self-love: Angelo &quot;stands at a guard with envy;
scarce confesses that his blood flows; or that his appetite is more to
bread than stone&quot; (1.3.51-53). The Duke's idealistic attempt to base
politics on natural affections is ultimately incompatible with just
political rule: he is neither willing himself to adopt the studied
sternness which political authority often entails, nor to trust Angelo's
conventional combination of honour and piety to do so, even though the
play suggests that this combination of motives can be more robust than
the Duke believes -as we have seen, Angelo's self-love is thoroughly
sublimated in a manner which encourages him to rule justly: ironically,
he is not corrupted by &quot;power,&quot; but by the Christian critique of pride.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, far from reflecting a natural warm-heartedness in the
way that he presumably believes, the Duke's leniency is itself primarily
self-regarding. Truly thoughtful and caring rulers, like truly &quot;fond&quot;
fathers--in the modern sense of that word--might well display an
artificial sternness when disciplining those in their care, rather than
attempting to secure their grateful affection through a clemency which
they know may ultimately prove to be highly damaging (1.3.31-43). The
unacknowledged corollary of the Duke's overmastering desire to avoid
&quot;slander&quot; is in fact an intense urge to win praise from the populace
(1.3.43). Although he declares that he eschews &quot;assemblies where youth,
and cost, witless bravery keeps,&quot; and believes that he &quot;does not relish
well&quot; his subjects' &quot;loud applause and aves vehement,&quot; he ends the play
by &quot;stag[ing]&quot; his generosity &quot;to their eyes&quot; in precisely the manner
which he originally claims should not be affected by men &quot;of safe
discretion&quot; (1.3.8-10, 1.1.67-72; see below).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the haughty fashion in which the Duke dismisses &quot;witless
bravery&quot; and even &quot;the dribbling dart of love,&quot; suggests that he
actually prides himself even on his apparent rejection of the world and
devotion to contemplation as much as Angelo and Isabella do (1.3.7-10,
1.1.27-29, 1.3.2-3). His conceit that Angelo &quot;stands at a guard with
envy&quot; inadvertently provides a hint that his apparently abstract
interest in &quot;see[ing] if power change [the] purpose&quot; of &quot;seemers&quot; is
in reality driven by his &quot;envy&quot; of a man whose reputation for austerity
exceeds his own (1.3.51-54; compare 3.2.235-37). The fencing image
implies that his desire to penetrate Angelo's &quot;guard&quot; is emulative
rather than purely philosophical, as he seems to believe. Later on in
the play, the Duke is doubtless gratified by the extended praise which
he manages to glean from Escalus, before his eager enquiries are
interrupted, for his apparently unstinting efforts to &quot;know himself&quot;
(3.2.230-41). It is significant that in the seemingly numerous
autobiographical &quot;bringings-forth&quot; by which the Duke strives to curate
his image, he prioritises intellectual over political and military
achievements: he wishes to &quot;appear to the envious a scholar, a
statesman, and a soldier&quot; (3.2.144-46).</p>
<p>This is not to deny that the Duke's disposition is contemplative: his
claim to have &quot;ever lov'd the life removed&quot; seems to be true, since it
is clear from his conversation with Friar Thomas that he has either
retreated to a monastery before, or at least frequently expressed a wish
to do so -although we may infer that he is not actually as thoughtful as
he would like to believe from the fact that during his current
retirement he seems more anxious to display his compassion than to
meditate (1.3.7-10). The arguments by which the Duke tries to reconcile
Claudio to dying appear on the face of it to be compatible with
Christian humility, but he actually goes far beyond Isabella's critique
of pride, which, however radical it might seem, is still moderated by
her assumption that human affairs are significant in the eyes of a
merciful God (2.2.73-79). For the Duke, human life is merely a
&quot;breath...servile to...hourly afflict[ions],&quot; while all our
&quot;accommodations...are nurs'd by baseness,&quot; since humankind merely
&quot;exists on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust&quot; (3.1.8-21).
His underlying materialism may be inferred from the fact that he makes
no reference to the afterlife in this speech, but simply equates death
with sleep.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> Elsewhere in the play he refers to the afterlife only
in public scenes (3.1.169-70, 3.2.30-31, 4.3.67-69, 5.1.480-86). The
Duke apparently follows Socrates in believing that it is only by
&quot;studying dying and being dead&quot; that one may divest oneself of a
groundless pride: those who fancy themselves &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;valiant&quot;
forget that worldly goods like riches, health and beauty are all
transient (3.1.13-41). <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Duke's reflections have certainly had some influence on his conduct:
Escalus's view that he is naturally &quot;a gentleman of all temperance,&quot;
who, &quot;above all other strifes, contended especially to know himself,&quot; is
much more likely to be accurate than Lucio's slanders (3.2.237; contrast
3.2.117-20, 3.2.181-84).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup> Ironically, however, despite seeming to
encourage a radical humility, the Duke's philosophising merely
facilitates the self-love by which it is primarily inspired; and,
moreover, in a manner that is particularly dangerous to the state.
Whereas Angelo's pursuit of heavenly &quot;glory&quot; demands that he strive to
maintain a sturdy indifference to common opinion, the Duke's pride is
not sublimated by piety in this way, which means that he is completely
reliant on the putative affection of his subjects to provide the high
regard which he craves. Neither piety nor shame impel the enlightened
Duke to control the excesses of his subjects in his own person, or
restrain him from appointing a deputy to do so whom he expects, and
indeed in large part hopes, will fail.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Duke is able to detach himself from the &quot;stew&quot; of
corruption which has in fact been fermented partly by his own rampant
desire to gain his subjects' affection, precisely because his philosophy
leaves no room for &quot;the dribbling dart of love&quot;: &quot;friend hast thou
none,&quot; he argues, on the grounds that even deep attachments last only as
long as the bodies of lovers (5.1.18-19, 3.1.28-32). Love of country is
presumably one of the many passions which the Duke dismisses as an
evanescent &quot;dream&quot; in the &quot;after-dinner's sleep&quot; of life (3.1.32-34). In
reality, his very compassion, which he perhaps imagines is born of a
combination of natural benevolence and searching reflections on the
pervasive fragility of the human condition, is itself merely one of
these &quot;dream[s],&quot; since it floats free of the duties and restraints
which genuinely sympathetic attachments impose. Thus, the Duke's
nihilistic philosophy undermines any motive which he might have had to
rule justly, while at the same time allowing his self-love to flourish
freely in a manner which remains entirely unacknowledged.</p>
<p>The Duke's decision to appoint Angelo as his deputy, while himself
adopting the role of friar, frees him up to embark on the task of
helping his subjects to transcend self-love and sensual desire, as he
imagines, a task which he clearly finds far more rewarding than that of
imposing strict laws, presumably because it tends to evoke gratitude
rather than resentment (see, for instance, 3.1.41). Although at first
the extreme decadence of Vienna forces him to consider reintroducing the
old, strict regime, as the play goes on we can see that the idealistic
Duke feels free to side-line laws which, from his point of view, merely
encourage the pride of officials like Angelo and the petty fears of
offenders, both of which motives seem futile if one considers that
humanity is &quot;merely...death's fool,&quot; and to urge his subjects to base
their conduct instead purely on their own passionate hearts and capacity
for philosophical thought (3.1.11). His efforts allow Shakespeare to
satirise apparently benevolent and enlightened attempts to base social
mores on voluntary principles rather than on strict laws.</p>
<p>The Duke's failure to induce Claudio to resign himself willingly to
death suggests that philosophy has only a limited power to control
self-love, at least in the general populace. After overhearing enough of
the conversation which follows his analysis of the ephemerality of all
human endeavours to know that, far from accepting his own
insignificance, Claudio is now intent on badgering Isabella to save his
life by acceding to Angelo's sexual demands, the Duke abruptly changes
tack (3.1.132-50). Having previously left Claudio's fate indeterminate,
since he wished to show him that there is less to choose between &quot;death
or life&quot; than he imagines, he now resorts to a blunt confirmation of the
legal position: &quot;to-morrow you must die&quot; (3.1.1-6, 3.1.169). It is this
announcement, rather than the Duke's philosophical musings, which
finally induces Claudio to declare that he is &quot;so out of love with life
that [he] will sue to be rid of it,&quot; and consequently to relax the
pressure which he has been applying to Isabella (3.1.171-72). Thus, the
Duke's dealings with Claudio ultimately underline the unrivalled
deterrent power of legal sanctions.</p>
<p>Shakespeare suggests that codes of honour and piety are only effective
where they are underwritten by such sanctions. Ironically, far from
deterring him from attempting to persuade Isabella to prostitute herself
in order to save his life, Claudio's intense fear of being &quot;perdurably
fin'd&quot; in an afterlife, where he vividly imagines his spirit &quot;howling&quot;
forever, actually increases his fear of execution at first, and,
paradoxically, leads him to ignore his sister's warnings of divine
retribution, as well as her appeals to his sense of shame (3.1.114-149,
3.1.63-80). This gives a clear hint that, however terrifying the threat
of Hell or purgatory might seem, it cannot be relied upon to restrain
self-love. It is only when the Duke is driven to confirm that &quot;tomorrow
[he] must die&quot; that Claudio finally &quot;go[es] to [his] knees&quot;
without protest and &quot;make[s] ready,&quot; presumably with prayers designed
precisely to mitigate any divine sanctions which he may have incurred
(3.1.169-70). Similarly, the contrast which the Duke implicitly draws
between Claudio and Isabella, who has &quot;the truth of honor in her,&quot;
eventually shames Claudio into apologising to his sister, but again,
only after he has learnt that he &quot;must die&quot; (3.1.164, 3.1.171). Although
shame and the fear of God could never match the force of legal
deterrents, we may infer from these latter points that they may
nevertheless often help to reinforce the laws.</p>
<p>After expressing a concern lest Juliet should regret her affair with
Claudio simply &quot;as that the sin hath brought [her] to this shame,
which sorrow is always to ourselves, not heaven,&quot; the Duke tries to
persuade her to &quot;spare heaven as we love it,&quot; rather than &quot;as we stand
in fear&quot; (2.3.30-34). Here again, as when he was ruling in his own
person, he wishes to substitute a morality based idealistically on
untrammelled love for imperatives which are enforced through fear,
whether of worldly dishonour, divine sanctions or stern legal
deterrents, all of which simply serve to encourage a self-regard that
seems utterly futile in the light of the Duke's relentless focus on
human transience. The atheistic Duke's advice to Julia is presumably
accommodated to her faith in a manner which is designed to lead her to
transcend what he conceives to be her self-love insofar as she is
capable of doing so.</p>
<p>Once the Duke has left, however, after informing her casually that her
&quot;partner...must die to-morrow,&quot; Juliet reveals that her overriding
emotion is simply terror at the prospective loss of her beloved: &quot;O
injurious love, that respites me a life whose very comfort is still a
dying horror&quot; (2.3.35-42). Although, for all we know, Juliet may well
also be subject to shame and a fear of divine retribution--deterrents
which, in the light of the above argument, the Duke arguably dismisses
rather too glibly--the overwhelming intensity of her &quot;horror&quot; is a sign
that she could probably only ever have been restrained from consummating
her relationship with Claudio by the threat of legal sanctions.</p>
<p>Juliet's brief soliloquy, like those of her famous namesake, reminds us
of the binding force of deep attachments. Her implication--which
confirms the truth of her fervid assertion that she loves her beloved as
dearly as herself (2.3.24-25)--that she would not wish to live without
Claudio, points to the power of deep attachment to transcend self-love.
Shakespeare implies that this power is far greater either than the piety
of Angelo and Isabella or the philosophy of the Duke, even though all
three of the latter characters initially profess an ascetic self-denial.
Indeed, the original determination of these characters to lead a &quot;life
removed&quot; is perhaps itself a sign that they lack the deep eroticism
which encourages both Juliet and her namesake to override their
self-regard. If the above argument is correct, it is in fact deeply
ironic that the Duke imagines that he is instructing Juliet in
self-denial. Whereas the ineffectiveness of the Duke's lecture to
Claudio indicates that Shakespeare agrees with Plato's view that on the
deepest level the passions of many who are primarily attached to the
body are opposed to any restraint,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup> his portrayal of Juliet
highlights the radical differences between the two thinkers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Duke's self-regarding pursuit of his subjects' grateful affection
continually impels him to personalise legal processes which, as he
himself actually understands as well as Angelo, are primarily designed
to provide broad, impersonal deterrents (1.3.19-31, 2.1.1-4,
2.2.90-104). As with Claudio and Juliet, he tries to convince Pompey to
&quot;mend&quot; rather than simply punishing him, confronting him with the fact
that he makes a living through the &quot;abominable and beastly touches&quot; of
his prostitutes, but this appeal to his capacity to understand and
transcend his own abjectness--a capacity which, the Duke seems to
assume, lurks just beneath the surface even of his most decadent
subjects--again proves to be ineffectual (3.2.24-27).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup> Just as in
the previous scene the Duke was eventually forced to abandon his lofty
philosophical musings and simply exploit Claudio's fear of the law and
divine sanctions, so now Pompey's unrepentant protests compel him to
abandon his original attempt to reason with him: eventually, after
reminding him curtly that he will probably be damned, he urges Elbow to
&quot;take him to prison&quot; (3.2.28-31). Even at this point, however, he still
concerns himself with the narrow--and almost certainly futile--task of
&quot;profit[ing]&quot; Pompey personally through &quot;correction and instruction,&quot;
rather than with the wider and far more potent functions of the legal
system, namely prevention and deterrence (3.2.32-33).</p>
<p>Having failed to persuade Juliet, Claudio and Pompey to transcend their
fear of the law, the Duke fails for a final time with Barnadine, a
self-confessed murderer (4.2.62, 4.2.139). His initial response to
Barnadine's insistence that, far from &quot;look[ing] forward on the
journey [he] shall go,&quot; as the Duke &quot;beseech[es]&quot; him to do, he has
&quot;been drinking hard all night, and will have more time to prepare,&quot; is
to repeat that the murderer must be brought &quot;to the block,&quot; since he has
a &quot;gravel heart,&quot; yet in the end, ironically, he delays precisely for
this reason, declaring that, since he is &quot;a creature unprepared, unmeet
for death,&quot; it would be &quot;damnable&quot; to &quot;transport him in the mind he is&quot;
(4.3.53-69). Here Shakespeare hints that, although the Duke is doubtless
hoping to soften Barnadine's heart through his lenience, he is more
concerned to preserve the purity of his own compassion, in which he
secretly takes such pride.</p>
<p>Under the Duke's old regime, the provost has &quot;oft awak'd&quot; Barnadine &quot;as
if to carry him to execution, and show'd him a seeming warrant for it,&quot;
but &quot;it hath not mov'd him at all&quot; towards penitence (4.1.142-52).
Barnadine has learnt to exploit the fact that those around him
prioritise his care, or, more accurately perhaps, their own
compassionate hearts, over his punishment: &quot;he hath evermore had the
liberty of the prison,&quot; and feels emboldened to &quot;swear [he] will not
die today, for any man's persuasion,&quot; knowing that his would be
executioners feel bound to wait for his &quot;consent&quot; (4.2.147-48,
4.3.53-63). In the final scene, the Duke goes even further towards
allowing &quot;liberty [to] pluck...justice by the nose,&quot; and releases
Barnadine altogether, apparently in the hope that he will be moved by
this act of mercy &quot;to provide for better times to come&quot; in the afterlife
(1.3.29-30, 5.1.480-86). Like the &quot;fond fathers,&quot; the Duke doubtless
hopes that compassion will breed compassion, whereas Shakespeare's
portrayal of hardened narcissists and sensualists like Pompey, Lucio and
Barnadine is designed to suggest that the &quot;truth&quot; which loving
relationships naturally demand needs to be safeguarded by strict
deterrents.</p>
<p>The story of Barnadine finally comes close to satirising explicitly the
Duke's compassionate approach. Readers and viewers who might sympathise
deeply with Juliet, pity Claudio, and laugh at the way in which even
Pompey escapes punishment through his appointment as an executioner,
could hardly agree with this latest example of the Duke's leniency,
since Barnadine is much more clearly a danger to the community
(4.2.8-59). His release shows how little the Duke really concerns
himself with the fate of that community as a whole. Not only is
Barnadine, unlike Claudio, &quot;reakless, and fearless of what's...to come,&quot;
but, unlike Pompey and Lucio, he remains as obdurately unaffected by
Angelo's stricter impositions as he is by the Duke's unfulfilled
threats, since he &quot;apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken
sleep&quot; (4.2.142-52). It would seem that such individuals can only be
prevented from committing crimes by execution or life imprisonment,
since they are immune to deterrents. The exigencies of political rule
have clearly led the Duke himself to take this view in the past, since
he too has conducted executions -although, by contrast with Angelo's
strict regime, it seems that his custom was simply to release all those
who did not merit the most severe punishment (4.2.132-34; contrast
4.3.4-19).</p>
<p>The Duke's compassionate approach has merely convinced Lucio that he
&quot;had some feeling for the sport; he knew the service, and that
instructed him to mercy&quot; (3.2.119-20). Lucio is inclined to judge the
Duke by his own standards, assuming that he is frequently drunk and
would &quot;mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown bread and garlic,&quot;
precisely because his ruler has presented himself as a peer who can be
&quot;know[n]&quot; and &quot;love[d],&quot; rather than as a lofty authority
(3.2.117-28, 3.2.181-84, 3.2.149). Lucio has absolutely no respect for
the Duke: when the latter tells him, as he does repeatedly in the final
scene, that he was &quot;not bid to speak,&quot; he replies insolently, &quot;No my
good lord, nor wish'd to hold my peace&quot; (5.1.78-87; see above). The
generalised way in which the Duke declares that &quot;no might nor greatness
in mortality can censure scape,&quot; and asks, &quot;What king so strong can tie
the gall up in the slanderous tongue?&quot; allows him to imply that he
himself has displayed strength and &quot;greatness in mortality&quot; without
directly making such an obviously disingenuous claim: he could be
understood to mean that anyone would find it impossible to control such
individuals (3.2.185-89).</p>
<p>Lucio's slanders show that the Duke's desire to ingratiate himself with
the populace is incompatible with the respect which rulers need to
inspire in order to exert authority, a respect which is inevitably
compounded partly of fear. Lucio is the Duke's nemesis, since he
embodies the self-loving and potentially immoderate elements within
human nature which may only be controlled by enforcing the laws
strictly. All of this is not to deny that the most effective rulers
might be admired as well as feared, but such admiration is necessarily
quite distinct from the reciprocated affection which the Duke seeks.
Rulers who truly care for their subjects must presumably accept that
they cannot express this care directly in the way that they might in
personal relationships, or in many cases be rewarded with the gratitude
that they deserve.</p>
<p>The fact that Lucio is the last person to be pardoned in the play, even
after Angelo and Barnadine, furnishes strong evidence for the Duke's
fundamental vanity. It is significant that Lucio's slanders continue to
exasperate him more than any of the other vices and crimes with which he
has had to deal--and certainly more than the plight of Kate
Keepdown--even when he is apparently immersed in what one might assume
to be more pressing matters (3.2.185-89, 4.1.59-64).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup> The ease with
which he is distracted from his plan to save Claudio's life and provide
Mariana with a husband provides further evidence that he merely
&quot;dream[s]&quot; of compassion, while his real concerns are primarily
self-regarding.</p>
<p>As well as encouraging his subjects to transcend the laws, the Duke
subverts them at every turn in the second half of the play. Angelo's
fall gives the Duke a pretext to focus on extending compassion to
individuals like Claudio, whom he now figures as being persecuted by a
corrupt authority, rather than on the laws which could have helped to
reverse the general &quot;dissolution&quot; of &quot;goodness&quot; in Vienna (3.1.222-23).
The shallowness of this new approach, which is sustained throughout the
last two acts, is underlined by the insistent rhymes and unusual
employment of heavily accented, end-stopped trochaic tetrameter in the
soliloquy in which it is announced (3.2.261-77).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup> This soliloquy
encourages most who see or read the play to move easily from their
condemnation of Angelo's hypocrisy to a critique of the severity of his
judgements, thus avoiding the problem of the decadence of Vienna, which
seemed at first to be the key theme of the play. Shakespeare's
calculated obfuscation of this issue is facilitated by the fact that
audiences will generally be more interested in individuals than abstract
political themes.</p>
<p>The Duke encourages this confusion when he remarks that, were Angelo
&quot;meal'd with that which he corrects, then were he tyrannous,&quot; for this
would only be true if his deputy were indeed to allow his private sins
to affect his public judgements; a step which he never actually takes in
the play (4.2.78-85). The shallowness of the Duke's original impulse to
care for his subjects by delegating his authority to Angelo is confirmed
by the assumption which he now reveals that the personal venality which
he expects his deputy to exhibit would automatically invalidate the
latter's efforts to reform Viennese society: he does not consider that
it might not matter whether &quot;thieves pass on thieves,&quot; even if they are
&quot;guiltier than him they try,&quot; nor that the individual failings of judges
might not necessarily prevent them from arriving at just verdicts, or,
crucially, diminish the deterrent effect of the sanctions which they
impose (2.1.18-26).</p>
<p>The Duke's contradictions are highlighted by his meditation on the
pardon which he assumes Angelo will grant Claudio after sleeping with
Isabella, which includes a rare acknowledgement that Claudio did after
all break the law: &quot;When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended, that for
the fault's love is th' offender friended&quot; (4.2.112-13). Although he
thus apparently reassures himself that he is continuing to pursue the
aim of reforming Vienna, we may infer from his subsequent efforts to
save Claudio's life, and the unconditional mercy which he eventually
extends to him, that if Angelo had actually kept to his side of the
bargain, the Duke would have done nothing to reverse it (4.2.92-209,
5.1.490-91). Because the audience is from now on encouraged to follow
the Duke in focusing on the individual issue of Angelo's corruption, it
is easy to forget that in his efforts to defend Claudio from what he now
styles as a &quot;tyrannous&quot; regime, he subverts the very laws which he
previously wished to revive (4.2.84). Originally, it should be
remembered, he simply strove to reconcile Juliet and Claudio to the
sanctions which they have incurred by their transgression. As even
Isabella herself eventually admits--while still under the impression
that her brother has actually been executed--Claudio &quot;had but justice,
in that he did the thing for which he died&quot; (5.1.448-49). The execution
of Claudio would have been entirely in accord with a law, while,
incidentally, bearing out the point that &quot;thieves may pass on thieves&quot;
with perfect justice.</p>
<p>The Duke subverts a variety of other laws in order to prosecute his
benevolent schemes. He actively encourages Mariana to commit the same
offence as Juliet and Claudio -and, it should be remembered, with the
intention of marrying her to a would-be rapist.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> He justifies his
plan for Mariana to sleep with Angelo in place of Isabella--a plan which
involves exploiting her reliance on his assumed spiritual authority,
which he confirms by &quot;confess[ing]&quot; her, even though he is not
qualified to do so (5.1.527)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup>--by assuring her that &quot;'tis no sin,&quot;
since he is her &quot;husband on a pre-contract,&quot; Angelo having withdrawn
from the engagement when she failed to produce a dowry (4.1.65-72,
3.1.224-27). Here, as always, the Duke prioritises compassion, in this
case for Mariana's &quot;tears&quot; and &quot;lamentation,&quot; over strict legality:
Angelo was quite within his rights to withdraw from a contract on which
his fiancée had defaulted. Moreover, we should not dismiss Angelo's
claim that he withdrew &quot;chiefly&quot; because Mariana's &quot;reputation was
disvalued in levity,&quot; since we only have the disingenuous Duke's word
for it that this is a lie (5.1.217-22). Lucio's blunt comment that if
Mariana is neither maid, wife or widow, she might be a &quot;punk&quot; points to
the seediness of the Duke's machinations in this part of the play
(5.1.177-80).</p>
<p>Similarly, the Duke eventually induces the initially reluctant provost
not only to disobey Angelo's orders, but to deceive his superior by
substituting another head for that of Claudio (4.2.159-209). At first,
the provost strives to restrain his sympathy for Claudio, but
subsequently, under the Duke's auspices, he even begins proactively to
suggest new schemes to subvert Angelo's orders (2.2.2-12, 3.2.60-61,
4.3.69-92). Overall, we may say that Lucio's description of Vincentio as
a &quot;Duke of dark corners,&quot; who would &quot;have dark deeds darkly answer'd,&quot;
never &quot;bring[ing] them to light,&quot; seems entirely justified
(4.3.156-58, 3.2.176-78).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup> His various compassionate subterfuges
contrast starkly with the transparent &quot;proclamation&quot; and publicly
advertised sanctions by which Angelo seeks to deter potential offenders
(1.2.93-94, 1.2.116-19).</p>
<p>The Duke does not in the end hide his casual attitude to the law in
&quot;dark corners,&quot; where it would at least not undermine public trust in
the legal system. Despite his earlier claim that he does &quot;not relish
well...loud applause and aves vehement,&quot; he ensures that his subjects
are there to witness his exposure of Angelo and his liberal dispensation
of pardons in the final scene (1.1.69-70, 4.4.5-17, 4.5.6-9, 4.6.12-15).
Here he endorses the actions both of Mariana and the provost, despite
publicly acknowledging that the latter's actions at least were morally
dubious (5.1.419-22, 5.1.456-62, 5.1.530-34). Although he threatens to
execute Lucio, he eventually does nothing more than force him to marry
his &quot;punk,&quot; while, as we have seen, he simply releases Barnadine in the
blind hope that he will reform (5.1.507-24, 5.1.482-86). In the end,
neither Angelo nor Claudio is given &quot;<em>Measure</em> still <em>for Measure</em>&quot;
(5.1.400-17, 5.1.496-98). Angelo's pardon in particular seems calculated
to frustrate the &quot;strong indignant claim of justice&quot; both of the
audience and the assembled crowd.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup> All these actions will doubtless
ensure that legal sanctions again &quot;become...more mock'd than fear'd,&quot;
with the inevitable result that &quot;truth&quot; will once again be degraded to
the point where &quot;societies&quot; and families are no longer &quot;secure;&quot; once
again, we may infer, &quot;liberty [will] pluck...justice by the nose,&quot;
while &quot;the baby beats the nurse&quot; (1.3.226-31, 3.2.226-28). The populace
may assume from now on that the regime will tolerate not only
extra-marital sex and oath-breaking, but slander, corruption and even
murder.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Duke perhaps betrays a guilty awareness that his actions have been
deeply inconsistent when he accuses Lucio of branding him &quot;a madman,&quot;
for the latter only actually censures him for incontinence (5.1.500-03,
3.2.117-28, 3.2.181-84, 4.3.161-62). His inconsistency is underlined in
the letters which he sends towards the end of the play, which
&quot;disvouch'd&quot; previous instructions to prepare for his return in a manner
which Angelo for one finds &quot;uneven and distracted&quot; to the point of
&quot;madness&quot; (4.4.1-5). The Duke's original instructions were seemingly for
a less public transition of power, but it seems that he has subsequently
decided that the ceremony must happen &quot;at the gates,&quot; and that all those
who &quot;crave redress of justice...should exhibit their petitions in the
street&quot; (4.4.5-10). This indecision might remind us that the Duke could
have exposed Angelo, issued his pardons and revealed that Claudio was
alive in private. One may surmise that he has been vacillating between
his reluctance to reveal the extent to which he has subverted the laws
and his pressing desire to exhibit his benevolence to his people.</p>
<p>The parallel between the portrayal of the murderous Barnadine as
&quot;apprehend[ing] death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep&quot; and
the Duke's declaration that humanity has neither &quot;youth nor age, but as
it were an after-dinner's sleep, dreaming on both,&quot; may be designed to
underline the dangers of philosophic detachment (4.2.142-52, 3.1.32-34).
Despite his superficial compassion, the Duke himself is in reality as
thoroughly emancipated as Barnadine, not only from the conventional
codes of shame and piety which normally help to moderate self-love, but
also from attachments, both patriotic and personal, and the self-denying
duties which they naturally entail. As we have seen, he dismisses love
itself as &quot;a dribbling dart,&quot; of no more significance than the other
transient goods which the world seemingly has to offer, such as
nobility, riches and health: &quot;Friend hast thou none&quot; (1.3.1-6, 3.1.28).</p>
<p>Indeed, the Duke shows a &quot;supreme indifference to human feeling&quot; in
pursuing his desire to distinguish himself.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup> He admires Isabella's
&quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;beauty&quot; sufficiently to propose to her in the end, but
we may deduce that he is by no means &quot;attorneyed to [her] service&quot; in
the way that he claims, since his plan to &quot;keep her ignorant of her
good&quot; seems designed to gratify his own desire to bring her &quot;heavenly
comforts of despair, when it is least expected,&quot; and no doubt to impress
his large audience, at the expense of delaying her release from grief
over her brother's death (3.1.180-84, 5.1.381-89, 5.1.490-93,
4.3.107-11). This detachment also manifests itself in the casual manner
in which he tells Juliet of her lover's imminent execution-- &quot;Your
partner, as I hear, is to die to-morrow&quot; (2.3.37)--and in the way in
which he toys with Angelo's emotions in the last scene, while
effectively torturing Mariana with the expectation that her new husband
will immediately be executed (5.1.400-55). Far from teaching him a deep
humility, as he imagines, his nihilistic philosophy simply encourages
him to pursue his ambitions without being impeded by the restraints
which personal and patriotic attachments might normally impose.</p>
<p>Shakespeare's critique of the Duke implies that the fulfilling
&quot;fellowships&quot; which naturally sustain &quot;societies&quot; require true
philosophers to focus on an intermediate sphere, situated somewhere
between Vincentio's panoptic focus on the ultimate insignificance of all
human endeavours, which is in fact irrelevant to constant lovers, and,
at the other extreme, the fickle distractions of self-love and
immoderate sensuality (3.2.226-28). <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup> The ultimate purpose of the
law seems to be to protect this sphere, guaranteeing the &quot;truth&quot; which
&quot;make[s] societies secure&quot; by depriving these latter distractions of
the &quot;security&quot; which &quot;make[s] fellowships accurs'd.&quot; The Duke knows
that the struggle to create an enclave of &quot;security&quot; for &quot;fellowships&quot;
is perpetual, since self-love is as instinctive as the desire to form
lasting attachments, yet he is not much affected by the knowledge: &quot;Much
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news is old enough,
yet it is every day's news&quot; (3.2.222-30).</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The play starts from the assumption that strict legal deterrents are
needed in order to protect &quot;truth&quot; and secure the &quot;fellowships&quot; and in
particular, one may presume, the families upon which society is founded
from the depredations of self-love and immoderate sensuality. These
lasting attachments naturally encourage many to restrain, or even in
some cases to transcend their self-love, but at the same time they may
themselves usefully be reinforced by laws against extra-marital sex.
Paradoxically, strictly administered laws are ultimately more
compassionate than leniency, since they express a &quot;pity [for]
those...which a dismiss'd offense would after gall&quot; (2.2.101-02). The
law can still fulfil its vital function as a deterrent, even if some
judges are corrupt and many offences are missed. Although the power of
codes of shame and piety to restrain the populace should by no means be
discounted, these codes can only function effectively as adjuncts to the
concrete and immediate threat of legal sanctions. Characters like Lucio
and Pompey, who are moved neither by these codes nor by lasting
attachments, may only be controlled by the threat of such sanctions,
while the few, like Barnadine, who are impervious even to these
deterrents simply need to be prevented from committing further crimes,
presumably either by execution or life imprisonment. Overall, the key
functions of the law are prevention and, in particular, deterrence,
rather than rehabilitation or retribution, since these are the functions
which protect the community as a whole.</p>
<p>Although there is an innate need for justice, which is naturally
provoked by the flouting of the &quot;truth&quot; that is required to sustain
lasting relationships, the dispassionate legal systems which are the
ultimate expression of this need demand that those who enforce them
preserve a cool, unsympathetic approach which is bound to feel
unnatural. Nevertheless, the Duke's initial manipulation of Angelo
implies that many may be moved to take on this uncongenial task by codes
of piety and honour. This combination of motives is more robust than the
Duke imagines: far from being corrupted by &quot;power,&quot; Angelo remains
thoroughly committed to his new role until Isabella reminds him so
forcefully that it conflicts with Christian doctrine. Indeed, Angelo's
initial careful enforcement of the laws suggests that traditional codes
of virtue are robust precisely because they are rooted in sublimated
pride.</p>
<p>Isabella shows that the task of those who are entrusted with enforcing
the law is fundamentally incompatible with the central tenets of
Christian doctrine, which suggest, not only that fallen humanity is
incapable of administering the law equitably, but that in any case the
attempt to do so is bound to be tainted by pride, and indeed hubris,
since it involves adopting a harsher approach than that of the merciful
God upon whom all ultimately depend for redemption. Since all are
innately guilty, one should ideally spend one's life contemplating
humbly one's own need for redemption, while forgiving the sins of
others, since these are merely the external symptoms of an ineluctable
weakness. Thus, Christian doctrine legitimises the natural reluctance
which many rulers and officials may feel to enforce strict deterrents.</p>
<p>Although the portrayal of Isabella and Angelo indicates that there are
residual elements within the Christian canon which encourage just rule,
since the old idea of a stern, authoritative God who demands dutiful
service still survives even in the New Testament, the play suggests that
these ultimately clash with the key doctrines outlined above. Indeed,
the conversations between Isabella and Angelo reveal that these
doctrines also undermine codes of personal probity: there is no motive
for an individual who believes that they are ineluctably flawed even to
control their own behaviour, let alone that of others, particularly if
they come to understand, as Angelo does, that conventional moral
principles are themselves rooted in sublimated pride. Angelo illustrates
both the ways of resolving the inconsistencies in Christian doctrine in
quick succession: one may either expect the same high standards of
others as one expects of oneself, or one may abandon these standards
completely. His moral descent shows that a secularised version of the
doctrine of original sin may ultimately promote an enlightenment which
threatens not only faith in just authority, but also the codes of piety
and honour which promote personal virtue.</p>
<p>The Duke's adoption of the role of friar, combined with his attempt to
induce Juliet to transcend self-regard through religious devotion,
suggests that there may be a symbiotic relationship in early modern
times between a piety which identifies God with compassionate love and
an 'enlightened' liberalism. Indeed, Wilson Knight notes that the Duke
resembles Jesus Himself in his preference for &quot;honest impurity&quot; over
&quot;Pharasaic self-righteousness,&quot; and in his willingness to create
&quot;apparent injustice&quot; through his unstinting mercy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup> His proposal to
Isabella at the end of the play directs our attention to the
similarities between Christian doctrine and the Duke's philosophical
ideas. Like Isabella, whose &quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;grace&quot; he so admires, the
Duke has double standards: Escalus's account of his habit of &quot;rejoicing
to see another merry,&quot; while remaining unmoved himself, may be designed
to echo Isabella's implication--admittedly as parodied by Angelo--that
her brother's &quot;sliding&quot; was rather &quot;a merriment than a vice,&quot; a view
which of course she would not dream of applying to herself (5.1.534-39,
3.1.180-84, 3.2.232-37, 2.4.114-16). The Duke resembles Isabella in
treating others compassionately, while exercising a strict control over
his own sensual desire -although in his case his ascetism is not rooted
in conventional piety, but in his naturally contemplative disposition.
Neither character focuses with sufficient clarity on the need to deter
the intemperate section of the populace from &quot;ravin[ing] down their
proper bane,&quot; and in the process, degrading the &quot;truth&quot; which makes
&quot;fellowships&quot; secure (1.2.129).</p>
<p>Like Isabella, the Duke depreciates the political sphere, considering
that power inevitably breeds corruption (1.3.50-54, 2.2.117-41).
Isabella maintains that a strict enforcement of the laws is incompatible
with the humble, penitent stance which the Christian faith values, while
the Duke views with distaste a legal system which, from his point of
view, merely encourages the deluded pride of officials like Angelo, and
exploits the petty fears of those whom they are appointed to deter. He
hopes instead to persuade the populace to transcend their self-love and
immoderate sensuality by appealing to their passionate hearts and
encouraging them to accept their own fragility and inconsequence. By
showing that this effort simply reduces society to a &quot;stew&quot; of
&quot;corruption,&quot; Shakespeare implicitly argues for the prudent use of
strict deterrents, which manipulate these low, but pervasive natural
forces in order to support the innate need to secure lasting
&quot;fellowships.&quot;</p>
<p>Ironically, the Duke's philosophising itself functions as an
unacknowledged means of rationalising his desire to distinguish himself
through his generosity, even as it saps all other motives of their
significance. Shakespeare's sardonic implication is that philosophers
who depreciate the sustaining power of deep attachments, which, as the
example of Juliet implies, may encourage a satisfaction which entails a
genuine self-denial, are likely simply to descend into the pettiness of
self-regard, even as they imagine that they are adopting a detached,
panoptic view of the transience of all human endeavours.</p>
<p>The Duke's desire to win praise for his benevolence, which flourishes
without being restrained either by codes of piety and honour or by
patriotic ties, represents a real threat to the state. His apparently
compassionate approach is in fact as detached as a &quot;dream&quot; in an
&quot;after-dinner's sleep&quot; from the real problems of Vienna. The Duke's
preferred role as an itinerant friar, who is not even a citizen of the
state, let alone a ruler who is largely responsible for the decadence by
which he is surrounded, allows him to dream that he is merely &quot;a
looker-on here in Vienna,&quot; and to view with gentle, contemplative pity
&quot;faults so countenanc'd, that the strong statutes stand like forfeits in
a barber's shop, as much in mock as mark,&quot; no doubt comforted all the
while by the thought that this disruption is, from the largest
perspective, as transient as &quot;an after-dinner's sleep&quot;
(5.1.315-22).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the one hand, Angelo's secularised version of the doctrine of the
Fall, in which human nature is seen as primarily sensual and
self-loving, arguably comes to form one of the more corrosive elements
of modern ideology, since it potentially undermines both the practice
and the perception of political authority; on the other, the Duke may be
seen as a forerunner of Enlightenment philosophers who, abandoning the
esotericism which was favoured in the classical tradition--as the Duke
does when he addresses the non-philosophical Claudio--sought to base
society on reason and mutual sympathy rather than on subjection to
authority, whether divine or human. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup> Leo Strauss notes that in the
systems of Hobbes and those he influenced, which attempt to base
themselves directly on natural passions, &quot;virtue is reduced
to...benevolence or kindness or 'the liberal virtues,'&quot; while &quot;'the
severe virtues' of self-restraint lose their standing.&quot; He goes on to
quote Edmund Burke's <em>Letter to Rivarol</em> (1791): &quot;The Parisian
philosophers...explode or render odious or contemptible, that class of
virtues which restrain the appetite...In the place of all this, they
substitute a virtue which they call humanity or benevolence.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup>
Shakespeare might deny that liberalism of this sort is inspired by a
truly heartfelt understanding of the disciplined conditions which are
required for deep attachments to thrive, and suspect that intellectuals
of this sort are actually more concerned to distinguish themselves than
to improve society. His overall warning is that in early modern times
the self-regarding idealism of &quot;political hedonism,&quot; to use Strauss's
term, might combine with a post-Christian pessimism to undermine the
stern virtues which are required for the just exercise of political
authority -or even, perhaps, for the maintenance of a rigorous personal
morality.</p>
<p>In particular, Barnadine's story can be seen as foreshadowing the way in
which modern liberal states may have difficulty in reconciling ever
expanding conceptions of individual rights with the need of the
community as a whole to protect itself. Wilson Knight is right to note
&quot;the peculiar modernity of the Duke in point of advanced psychology,&quot; in
that &quot;the case of Barnadine troubles him intensely,&quot; although his
assumption that Shakespeare approves of his delicate conscience is, I
believe, mistaken.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup> Indeed, many modern thinkers reject the very
idea of retribution, since it ignores the complex causes of criminal
activity, while relying on judges who, it is sometimes now assumed, are
distinguished from those whom they sentence only by their superior
power. From Shakespeare's point of view, which he allows Angelo to
express so eloquently, this is to forget that, without sanctions,
however imperfectly just, it would be impossible to impose the
deterrents upon which the rule of law ultimately depends (2.1.1-26,
2.2.93-104).</p>
<p>Shakespeare resembles Plato rather than the philosophes in conforming
outwardly to the dominant moral and religious principles of his time:
even as he lays out the flaws in Christianity for those who wish to
examine them, he encourages his audiences to celebrate the merciful
approach of Isabella and the Duke, if they feel inclined to do so. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup>
He agrees with Plato also on the role which noble and pious guardians
might be induced to play in defending the state. However, I would argue
that he differs from him on the key issue of the relationship between
politics and philosophy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup> The corollary of Shakespeare's critique of
the Duke's approach is that some philosophers, whose curiosity may
naturally be regulated by their attachments, might actively wish to take
on the uncongenial task of ruling out of a deep love for their country,
and further, that, if they did so, would, like truly &quot;fond fathers,&quot;
expect nothing in return for their patriotism but the knowledge that
they had protected &quot;fellowships&quot; by enforcing the laws which restrain
self-love and immoderate sensuality.</p>
